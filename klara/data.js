        "<p>In traditional applications, users are required to sign-in so providers can verify and manage data on their behalf. On Stacks, users retain complete control over their personal information and credentials, which introduces changes to the authentication flow you may be familiar with.</p>",
      name: "How to Authenticate Your Users ✅",
      "post-body":
        '<p>Here, authentication refers to an information exchange between a user’s authenticator and an application a user wishes to interact with. Typically, applications need some knowledge about their users. For example, a DeFi protocol needs to know about the assets a user holds in their authenticator, and a writing app needs to connect users with the notes they’ve taken in the past. Let’s take a look at how it works.</p><p>On the surface, the authentication flow on Stacks is similar to the typical client-server flow used by centralized sign-in services. The key difference is that authentication occurs entirely client-side; no user information needs to be passed to a server.</p><h2>Authentication at a High Level</h2><p>In this authentication flow, you have two parties: an app and an authenticator (aka wallet or agent of the user, like the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet">Hiro Wallet</a>). In order to verify the user’s identity, these two parties pass two tokens back and forth to authenticate the user.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>authRequest</strong>: the token sent by the app requesting authentication.</li><li><strong>authResponse</strong>: the token sent back by the user’s authenticator.</li></ul><p>Those tokens are passed back and forth via a URL query string.&nbsp;</p><p>First, an app creates an ephemeral transit key, for the sole purpose of the authentication. The public part of this ephemeral transit key is passed to the authenticator within the authRequest token.</p><p>The authenticator then uses the received public key (of the ephemeral transit key) to encrypt an <strong>app private key</strong>, which is returned in the authResponse token. The app private key is generated from the user’s private key and from the app’s domain. This key is deterministic, meaning the key will always be the same for a given Stacks address and app domain.</p><p>Once the authResponse token is sent back, the app should have all necessary information to perform its services. This whole communication using tokens might sound complicated but is completely handled by the functions provided in the Stacks.js libraries.</p><h2>Keeping Track of User State and Setting Permissions</h2><p>Apps can obtain this information, as well as the current authentication state of a user, through the userSession object.</p><div></div><p>Before we start to authenticate, it’s important to determine the correct permissions your app needs from a user and configure them using the <strong>appConfig</strong> object. You can request any of the following permission scopes:</p><ul><li><strong>store_write</strong>: this allows the app to read and write data to the user’s Gaia hub in a storage bucket specific to the app. This is a good fit for applications that need to store user data, but have no need to make that information publicly accessible, like a note taking application.</li><li><strong>publish_data</strong>: this allows the app to publish data, so other users of the app can discover and interact with that user and that published data. This permission is important for applications that have a network component, such as social media applications.</li></ul><p>Creating a <strong>new AppConfig()</strong> without providing permission scopes will default to only the <strong>store_write</strong> scope.</p><h2>Initiating the Authentication Flow</h2><p>To prompt new and existing users to authenticate, you can use the <strong>showConnect</strong> function:&nbsp;</p><div></div><p>Calling this function (e.g. via a button’s onclick) from the app triggers the Hiro Wallet (or another authenticator), prompting them to go through the authentication flow. From there, the user can generate a new address if needed or select an existing one before returning to the app. As you can see in the code above, the function also allows you to pass through a few properties to customize the appearance of the modal, including:<br></p><ul><li>The <strong>name</strong> and <strong>icon</strong> of the app</li><li>A <strong>redirectTo</strong> string that provides a URL that users will be redirected to after they successfully authenticate</li></ul><p>The authentication modal ultimately looks something like:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:80%" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="80%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6247224ffac0fac5176b8bc6_authentication_modal.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We created the connect package in Stacks.js, to make implementing authentication a straightforward and easy process for app developers. I hope this overview was helpful for those looking to gain an understanding of how it works.

        '<p>Today, $228B is <a href="https://defillama.com/">locked in DeFi protocols</a> across different blockchains. Since the Stacks mainnet launch a little over a year ago, we’ve seen a lot of exciting progress in Bitcoin DeFi. Let’s take a look at some of the things developers have built.</p>',
      name: "Breaking Down DeFi Code Snippets in Clarity",
      "post-body":
        '<p>Unlike other DeFi protocols, Bitcoin DeFi is built with <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a>, a programming language that is different from other smart contract programming languages in two important ways.</p><ol><li>The language is interpreted and broadcasted on the blockchain as is (it’s not compiled). This ensures that the executed code is human-readable, and in fact with Clarity, the source code for every smart contract is made available on the blockchain. This means that anyone can audit and verify a specific smart contract if they want to.</li><li>The language is decidable (not Turing incomplete). This means that it is possible to determine precisely what a program will do purely based on the code. This allows developers to accurately determine things like runtime costs and data usage.</li></ol><p>Let’s take a look at the powers of Clarity in action with a few examples.</p><h2>Declaration of the DIKO Fungible Token</h2><p><a href="https://arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a> is a DeFi protocol on the Stacks blockchain that serves a number of different functions, including creating the first stablecoin in the ecosystem USDA, offering self-repaying loans, as well as adding liquidity to the ecosystem through a number of different pools for different trading pairs.</p><p>Arkadiko uses the token DIKO for governance on the Arkadiko Protocol. This token is the main coordination mechanism they use within the ecosystem. Let’s take a look at that code:</p><div></div><p>This token uses the correct <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md">SIP-010</a> declaration functions to configure the metadata for the DIKO token used on the platform. DIKO serves as the governance token of the Arkadiko Protocol and is the main coordination mechanism used within the Arkadiko ecosystem. It is necessary to have the default set of functions from the FT (fungible token) trait available in order to perform important token operations such as transferring an asset or querying metadata of a particular cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p><p>This contract correctly implements the seven functions from the SIP-010 fungible token trait.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:80%" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="80%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/62460ac388acc19ae6ac8030_fungible_token_functions.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>With this concise but powerful set of default functions, users can execute an array of operations on the Arkadiko platform using the DIKO token. Additionally, this developer included one more unique function when creating the contract. The <strong>set-token-uri</strong>, is similar to <strong>get-token-uri</strong>, but with some special permissions. It can be called only by the owner of the smart contract (the principal that deployed the Clarity file to the public Stacks blockchain), and is used to update the token’s metadata. If this function is called by someone other than the contract owner, it throws an <strong>ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED</strong> error.&nbsp;</p><p>You can see the contract in full on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/boomcrypto/clarity-deployed-contracts/blob/main/contracts/SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR/arkadiko-token.clar">here</a>, or in action on the <a href="https://explorer.bitfari.com/txid/SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR.arkadiko-token?chain=mainnet">Stacks Explorer</a>.</p><h2>CryptoMate Swap&nbsp;</h2><p><a href="https://cryptomate.me/">CryptoMate</a> is a Latin American-based token swapping platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency with other individuals. It’s a completely decentralized platform that uses smart contracts to handle all the business logic behind-the-scenes. They’ve even set up a helpful <a href="https://t.me/charlymate_bot">Telegram bot</a> that walks beginners through the basics of the application and enables certain features through the Telegram chat app.&nbsp;</p><p>A token swapping platform requires a robust array of Clarity smart contracts on the back end to handle orders, liquidity, pricing, and more, and the CryptoMate developer(s) was sure to instantiate a multitude of constant variables at the top of their contract for use throughout. A whooping 26 constant variables are defined, and they all store important data needed for executing swaps. </p><div></div><p>Let’s highlight a few of these constants.</p><ul><li><strong>tx-sender</strong> is defined as the owner of the contract. This gives the original individual who deployed the contract special control over operation of the platform. Later in the contract, a percentage of the fees are disbursed to the owner of the contract as compensation for offering a user-friendly, secure, functional platform.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Invalid-pair-err</strong> is a defined error constant. You can envision this being utilized when a user tries to execute a trade on a token pair that is invalid. For example, if a user tried to swap two tokens that don’t exist on the platform, or they attempt a pointless swap like SOL to SOL, then an error would occur.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Too-much-slippage</strong> is another defined error. Slippage in trading is any situation in which a market participant receives a different trade execution price than intended, one in which the price “slips.” This can occur when there is extremely low liquidity, and the trade being executed moves the price above or below the estimated value. This valuable safeguard can protect users from making a financially dangerous trade, and disallow disadvantageous swaps.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Under-the-hood, CryptoMate’s swap smart contract is responsible for establishing valid token pairs based on availability and liquidity. That means we need an account of all token pairs, along with the token metadata, in order for the contract to function. Further down in the contract, you can find the map declaration, a useful Clarity data structure leveraged to hold important token information, including that metadata.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/language-functions#map">map</a> is one of the most powerful functions in Clarity. Those familiar with programming can most easily compare it to an array. It’s a multi-dimensional data structure in which similar elements of information are grouped and archived together.</p><div></div><p>In this code snippet we see an essential function from the CryptoMate Swap contract. The developer of this contract uses the <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#define-map">define-map</a> function to establish a data structure to inventory all the available token pairs users can perform swaps with. It organizes metadata into a multivariable list, where important token information is stored, like principal contracts for each token and the accompanying liquidity token of the application.&nbsp;</p><p>You can view the contract in full on <a href="https://github.com/boomcrypto/clarity-deployed-contracts/blob/main/contracts/SP32NTG209B861QBHF4TH0C86QB0A12TY2F16WHMY/cryptomate-swap.clar">GitHub</a> as well as on the <a href="https://explorer.bitfari.com/txid/SP32NTG209B861QBHF4TH0C86QB0A12TY2F16WHMY.cryptomate-swap?chain=mainnet">Stacks Explorer</a>.</p><h2>xBTC&nbsp;</h2><p>One of the most exciting innovations to emerge on the Stacks blockchain over the last year is the development of the <a href="https://medium.com/wrapped/wrapped-btc-xbtc-is-headed-to-stacks-4c58793a5dca">xBTC token</a>. This enables a method of “wrapping” native Bitcoin as xBTC for use on the Stacks network. Developed by <a href="https://www.tokensoft.io/">TokenSoft</a>, xBTC allows a whole new set of use cases, such as NFTs, trading pairs, and AMMS all denominated in xBTC, which is paired 1:1 with Bitcoin itself. It’s a huge step forward for applications in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p>The xBTC smart contract is massive and handles countless operations. The Clarity code facilitates role-based access control, minting, burning, transfers, trait implementation, and initialization of the token.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, their blacklist functionality is one of the most novel and important features of the smart contract. Crypto strives to be totally decentralized, but it’s been proven with a plethora of incidents that having an authority with a privileged role can be extremely beneficial in some cases. If there is a malicious or bad actor attempting to abuse the platform, having a blacklist feature to ban attackers or abusers can protect other users. Let’s take a look at how that works in practice:</p><div></div><p>Here we see three functions from the xBTC contract that establishes blacklisting parameters. The first defines a <strong>map</strong> named <strong>blacklist</strong>. This is a simple data structure that contains a list of principals (accounts) that use the platform, and an accompanying boolean variable signaling if a specific principal’s blacklist status is true or false.&nbsp;</p><p>The second is a <strong>read-only</strong> function that checks if a principal is included in the blacklist, and whether the user should be limited from using xBTC features. It does a simple query of the blacklist map, and if a principal has the accompanying true boolean signaling a wallet address is blacklisted, they lose access.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the final function allows an authority figure (with the designated <strong>BLACKLISTER_ROLE</strong>) to update the blacklist, appending or omitting principals from the map of blacklisted addresses. This is critical for an arbiter to remove hackers, loophole investigators, manipulating whales, and everything in between.&nbsp;</p><p>Further down in the contract, you can observe the blacklist hard at work:</p><div></div><p>In the <strong>detect-transfer-restriction </strong>function, there is a conditional if-statement. First, the function locates a specific principal in the blacklist map that was set up earlier. If the associated boolean is true, then an error is thrown, and feedback is given to the user explaining that their address is prevented from transacting. If the associated boolean is false, then that means the principal is <em>not </em>on the blacklist and has access to all the features of the xBTC smart contract.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn so much about fungible tokens written in Clarity from this monster contract. Take a look at it on <a href="https://github.com/wrappedfi/wrapped_token_stacks/blob/main/contracts/wrapped-bitcoin.clar">Github</a>, or deployed live on the <a href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/SP3DX3H4FEYZJZ586MFBS25ZW3HZDMEW92260R2PR.Wrapped-Bitcoin?chain=mainnet">Stacks Explorer</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>DeFi is one of the most popular spaces in crypto for a reason. It adds liquidity to the network and enables a lot of the fundamental building blocks that will be used to create applications. I’m thrilled to see what DeFi developers come up with next.

        "<p>Hiro had its first retreat in a post-pandemic world. It was everything we wanted it to be and maybe not what you’d expect…we didn’t ‘do work.’</p>",
      name: "Putting Team First: A Recap of Hiro’s Annual Retreat",
      "post-body":
        '<p>Hiro gathered for an all-inclusive experience in Riviera Maya, Mexico for our first team retreat since 2019. There was sun, surf, an absurdly competitive scavenger hunt, and too many tacos to count. It was everything we wanted it to be. What I learned from those few days in Mexico is that relationships are everything, and camaraderie wins the day.&nbsp;</p><h2>Daydreaming of Meeting the Team</h2><p>I joined Hiro two years ago, early on in the pandemic. I spent my first few months working on a ‘return to office’ plan. I strolled south from my midtown apartment to our offices in Flatiron once a week to water the plants. I chatted with my fellow NYC colleagues on Slack, daydreaming about the happy hours we’d plan once things got back to normal.</p><p>As the months passed by, I found myself looking for new homes for those beloved office plants (after 6 months of keeping them alive, I felt personally attached to them). I gave away our office snacks to whoever would take them and asked folks what they wanted me to do with the hoodies they left on the back of their chairs. It was clear that WFH wasn’t going to be temporary. We weren’t coming back to this space.</p><p>Fast forward to today: we’re still in our home offices around the world, and I feel <strong>closer than ever</strong> to my fellow Hiro’s.</p><p>When I was planning this retreat I asked Alex, our CEO, what he wanted to cover with the team. I figured he’d say something about strategy or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results, a goal-setting framework we use at Hiro), but he shocked me when he said, “Let’s just hang out.” My jaw hit the floor. I relayed this to <a href="https://www.rosegoldcollective.com/">our event planners</a>, and we scratched our heads trying to figure out what to do with the conference space we paid for. Here’s what we came up with:</p><h2>The Agenda</h2><p>Day 1</p><ul><li>Welcome reception on the beach at sunset, complete with Hiro-branded coconuts for drinks!

My business school brain wasn’t prepared for a retreat of this nature, but holy moly was it effective. We’re a remote first company, and we took the retreat as an opportunity to build relationships with each other instead of simply working in the same room together. Through that decision, virtual friendships were solidified, and so much context was absorbed. Even better, the retreat maximized our excitement for what’s to come. Bitcoin is changing the world, and through Hiro\'s developer tools, we empower developers to build new applications for Bitcoin and unleash its full potential. And there’s a place for you to join us too.</p><blockquote>We’re a remote first company, and we took the retreat as an opportunity to build relationships with each other instead of simply working in the same room together. </blockquote><p>Hiro is doubling the team in 2022 and growing even larger in 2023. This is a brilliant team tackling hard problems, and if you are interested in the cutting edge, Hiro may be the place for you. Hiro is the best place I’ve ever worked because we have a team that truly values its people and sees each member as an individual that is more than their job description. Come see for yourself. <a href="https://www.hiro.so/careers">Check out our careers page</a> to learn more!</p><p>P.S. We do have an amazing new office in Union Square in New York City, for those who <strong>want</strong> a place to visit with their colleagues. We have fake plants this time around, but the snacks are just as good.&nbsp;</p>',

      name: "The Hiro’s Journey With Elena Giralt",
      "post-body":
        '<p>Our guest this week is Elena Giralt, a Product Marketing Manager at Hiro. You can usually find her researching market trends, writing feature announcements or planning campaigns—whatever it takes to shine a light on Hiro’s amazing products!</p><h2>Thanks for volunteering to be a guest on the Hiro’s Journey! Tell us a bit about yourself.</h2><p>I would describe myself as hard-working and easy-going. I feel incredibly lucky to work at Hiro, where I can connect with and learn from the growing community of Stacks developers and builders.&nbsp;</p><p>I first discovered blockchain in 2018 while I was in grad school. I researched crypto adoption in Venezuela, where my family is originally from, and became fascinated with the technology and its potential.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of work, I run <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-Latinx/">Blockchain Latinx</a>, a monthly meetup group that explores what blockchain means for Latinos and for Latin America. Outside of crypto, I like puzzles, scavenger hunts and debating big ideas.&nbsp;</p><h2>How did you end up at Hiro?</h2><p>I first heard about Blockstack when Muneeb came to speak at a Digital Currency class I was taking at NYU. I was really interested in what he described as the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-tech-stack-for-building-web3-apps">tech stack for web3</a> and the evolution of the internet from read-write to read-write-own. Years later, what ultimately drew me to Hiro was the people. Gina and Kaitlin encouraged me to join the growing marketing team, and the rest is history.</p><blockquote>What ultimately drew me to Hiro was the people.</blockquote><h2>What are some of your favorite things about the team and our culture?</h2><p>The team at Hiro is ambitious—engineering moonshots is one of the core company values. What this means in practice is that I get to work alongside uniquely talented individuals to realize the vision of building a better, more secure internet. No two days are the same!</p><p>I’d also add that Hiro respects and celebrates the fact that you have a life outside of work. Many companies say they value work-life balance, but at Hiro there is a strong culture of taking the time you need to recharge and rebalance. As a new mom, I appreciate that.</p><h2>What are some of the projects you’ve been working on recently?</h2><p>Most of my work happens behind the scenes. This includes market research, user interviews and helping craft messaging for upcoming products and features. Currently, I am most excited about plans we have for <a href="https://bitcoinunleashed.org/">Bitcoin Unleashed</a> in Miami on April 5-6. It will be the largest Stacks community gathering of the year, and I’ll be sharing the developer stage with Joe Bender, our community manager! Bring your bucket hats. It’s going to be fun.</p><h2>What has been the biggest surprise since you joined?</h2><p>I was pleasantly surprised by the extent to which Hiro collects and responds to community feedback to inform product decisions. From the discord channels to the developer surveys, one-on-one conversations to GitHub discussions, everyone at Hiro is committed to listening, learning and making developers\' lives easier.&nbsp;</p><p>The second thing that surprised me is how fast we are growing the team to meet the demands of the Stacks ecosystem. By the way, <a href="https://www.hiro.so/careers">we’re hiring</a>, so now is a great time to join if you are on the fence about diving into web3!</p><h2>What do you enjoy outside of work?</h2><p>I get a lot of inspiration and energy from people. Whether it’s listening to interviews from <a href="https://storycorps.org/">StoryCorps</a> or attending a local meetup, I am always curious to learn about different perspectives and ideas. I also like discovering hidden gems off the beaten path. I usually check out <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/">Atlas Obscura</a> for unusual landmarks whenever I visit a new place.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ok, super-Hiro, if you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?</h2><p>Vulcan mind-meld, hands down. For the uninitiated, a Vulcan mind-meld comes from the show <em>Star Trek</em>, and it refers to a telepathic way to share your thoughts with someone else. I like this superpower because in a perfect world, we would all be able to understand each other’s perspectives.</p><h2>What is your advice for someone contemplating a move to work in crypto full-time?</h2><p>I actually wrote <a href="https://manasilvora.medium.com/how-to-land-a-crypto-job-28fcbe56d19d">an article</a> about this with Manasi Vora, a good friend of mine and Web3 all star! My main advice is to start with what you know. Chances are, there is a blockchain-related use case or startup that is related to something you are passionate about. This is true for fashion, food, space travel - you name it, someone’s putting a blockchain on it! By starting with an area you’re already interested in, you’ll be able to identify gaps in the market and find opportunities to jump in and add value.</p>',

Clarity itself is a relatively new programming language. It was created in 2020, but was just recently recognized as an <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarity-making-it-github-official">official programming language on GitHub</a>.</p><p>As developers have gone from tinkering to launching products, we’re beginning to see common programming patterns and useful reusable code snippets start to emerge from various projects in the ecosystem.</p><p>Let’s take a look at a few of those snippets that are surfacing for NFTs.</p><h2>Boom Sets the Metadata for Their NFT</h2><p><a href="https://boom.money/">Boom</a> is one of the earliest NFT projects on Stacks. Boom is a wallet that can manage all of a user’s assets on Stacks, including NFTs, and Boom can also help users create their own custom NFTs too. One of the more interesting NFT applications that Boom has developed is their creation of “<a href="https://boom.money/boomboxes">boomboxes</a>”, which are NFTs that act as a certificate of redemption for <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet-faq/how-does-stacking-work">pooled Stacking rewards</a>.</p><p>Let’s pop the hood, take a look at some of Boom’s Clarity code, and investigate the functionality being performed.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/623b51e6e0e8e940374977dc_boomnft.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>This single line of code lets the Stacks network know that this smart contract adheres to the requirements for non-fungible assets as defined in the NFT standard, <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-009/sip-009-nft-standard.md">SIP-009.</a> It provides the <a href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0x80eb693e5e2a9928094792080b7f6d69d66ea9cc881bc465e8d9c5c621bd4d07?chain=mainnet">address of another contract</a>, already live on the blockchain, that serves as a template (referred to as a “trait”) that other contracts can extend.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/623b52178517f42fd72d22f6_nft_standard.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>By implementing the SIP-009 NFT trait, the boomboxes contract ensures interoperability, enabling a default set of NFT operations such as identifying the owner (<strong>get-owner </strong>function) or transferring an asset (<strong>transfer</strong> function).</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/623b522a24e11840c3f324ca_boom_metadata.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>This two-line function is another simple but powerful code snippet that adds metadata to the non-fungible asset.

This designates a visual accompaniment to the NFT certificate, allowing the NFT to function as a piece of digital artwork. It’s also awesome that Boom is hosting the image on their own website: breaking content free from AWS or Imgur is another step towards web decentralization!</p><p>There are loads more valuable snippets throughout the Clarity contract. You can see Boom’s contract in full on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/boomcrypto/clarity-deployed-contracts/blob/main/contracts/SP1QK1AZ24R132C0D84EEQ8Y2JDHARDR58R72E1ZW/boom-nft-300.clar">here</a>.</p><h2>Bulk Transfer Your NFTs</h2><p>Some of you avid NFT collectors might be amassing quite the large collection by now.

      "post-body":
        '<p>In the past year, NFTs have experienced explosive growth. In part, that rise has been due to the gaming industry. More than 21.6 million gaming NFT were sold across almost two million wallets for a <a href="https://nonfungible.com/market/history">combined transactional value of $4.6 billion</a>.</p><p>Bitcoin (and crypto in general) is becoming <a href="https://harbert.auburn.edu/news/is-cryptocurrency-going-mainstream-yes-but-theres-more-to-the-story.html">increasingly popular</a>, but it still has a long way to go towards unlocking mainstream adoption. Beyond financial use cases like trading, investments, and payments, there aren’t many applications to convince the average person to participate in the Bitcoin economy. Gaming NFTs provide developers with a new opportunity to attract the general public by bringing the gaming community into the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><h2><strong>What Are Gaming NFTs?</strong></h2><p>Gaming NFTs are a subset of <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-nfts-explained-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-why-you-should-build-them">NFTs</a> (non-fungible tokens), which are digital assets with verifiable uniqueness and enforceable digital scarcity. In the world of gaming, NFTs can represent unique assets in a game, such as characters, weapons, powers, cosmetic skins, and more. They help create legitimacy for gaming assets, establish ownership, and enable the transfer of these assets.</p><p>Gaming NFTs are <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/">changing the gaming industry</a> across different gaming verticals. And some of the most NFT innovative use cases in gaming include projects like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://sorare.com/"><strong>Sorare</strong></a>:<strong> </strong>A fantasy sports game in which users create and manage virtual teams to compete in fantasy soccer leagues. Users buy trading cards representing professional soccer players and build a team to compete with other Sorare users. The cards are publicly tradable, and their value rises or falls over the course of the soccer season based on the performance of the players and their teams.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/"><strong>Axie Infinity</strong></a>:<strong> </strong>A Pokémon-style game in which players collect, breed, and trade virtual pets called Axies.

To understand the fundamental shift these NFTs enable, let’s take a brief look at the history of mobile gaming.</p><p>In 2008, when a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone-games1-idUKSP2815220080711">new generation of mobile games</a> made their debut alongside the iPhone 3G and the App Store, not many people thought they were a big deal. People had low expectations from mobile games because they were an unproven new category. Why play mobile games when you had gaming consoles and PCs?</p><p>However, the introduction of freemium models and in-app purchases in games such as Angry Birds, Clash of Titans, and Candy Crush established mobile games as a market segment that should be taken seriously. By 2020, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/511639/global-mobile-game-app-revenue/">mobile gaming app revenue</a> had reached $86.9 billion, and it’s forecasted to reach $116.4 billion by 2024. Revenue from in-app purchases contributes between <a href="https://www.statista.com/study/41424/gaming-monetization-statista-dossier/">54% and 81% of that total revenue</a> to outpace ad revenue altogether in most cases. To make the market even more attractive to developers, the players who don’t make in-game purchases often <a href="https://img03.en25.com/Web/LLNW/%7B46b8ee89-c7f0-46b7-a5b3-0976ef1a3253%7D_2021-MR_SOOG_8.5x11_V06.pdf">spend hours playing games</a> and earning upgrades for their character’s gear and skills.</p><p>The point is that people spend a lot of time and money earning these in-game assets. However, when users stop playing a game, all the money and time spent on acquiring special gear and items are lost. Those assets are trapped in the game. This is where gaming NFTs change the nature of the game entirely. Gaming NFTs offer a way to turn in-game assets into assets with real-life value.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to gaming NFTs, if a gamer bought a magic wizard staff or spent 11 hours on a quest to acquire one, the money and time spent is lost if the user stops playing the game because the staff has no real-world value. There was nowhere you could go to sell it. The asset was trapped in the game.</p><p>However, if the wizard staff was an NFT, players can trade it for other gear, transfer it to another player, or simply sell it for crypto or fiat. Whatever choice the user makes, gaming NFTs give in-game assets utility beyond the game by enabling marketplaces for them. And because it is easy to verify the provenance of NFTs, users can verify the authenticity of an in-game asset even when they aren’t buying it directly from the game developers.</p><p>In an industry where in-app purchases are generating tens of billions of dollars for mobile app gaming companies, opening those assets up to secondary sales fundamentally changes the structure of the industry. It forces game developers to rethink how to architect the next generation of games while simultaneously adding entirely new incentives for players. This change has created a new category entirely: play-to-earn games, in which players can earn real money through playing games by selling the in-game assets they collect along the way.</p><h2><strong>3 Ways Gaming NFTs Can Accelerate Bitcoin’s Adoption</strong></h2><p>In the last few year, NFTs have become popular on second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum. However, an often-forgotten fact is that NFTs have their <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/31/rare-pepe-steeped-in-bitcoin-history-fetches-500k-on-nft-market-opensea/">earliest history in Bitcoin</a>. Now, through Stacks, developers can create use cases for gaming NFTs within the Bitcoin ecosystem. And by creating gaming NFTs for Bitcoin, developers help create new on-ramps for the gaming community to interact with the Bitcoin economy. Here’s how gaming NFTs will grow the Bitcoin economy.</p><h3><strong>Introduce Gamers to Bitcoin and Grow the User Base</strong></h3><p>There are more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/512112/number-mobile-gamers-world-by-region/">2.65 billion mobile gamers</a> in the world. Of those, <a href="https://resources.newzoo.com/hubfs/Newzoo_Gamer_Segmentation.pdf">Newzoo’s gamer segmentation</a> says 10% of gamers are “Ultimate Gamers” and 8% are “All-round Enthusiasts” — and both personas spend a lot of time and money on games. Based on these two personas alone, that’s an estimated addressable market of 18% of mobile gamers or 477 million gamers.</p><p>Gaming NFTs could make an easier and more compelling entry point to Bitcoin for these gamers. And because Bitcoin is a household name, it may make play-to-earn opportunities more interesting to gamers than opportunities to earn less well-known cryptocurrencies.</p><p>To put these numbers into perspective, Glassnode estimates the total number of active Bitcoin wallets at <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=addresses.ActiveCount&resolution=1w&s=1230508800&u=1644796800&zoom=">16.5 million</a> for the month of January 2022. If gaming NFTs on Bitcoin attract only 5% of these 477 million enthusiastic mobile gamers, the Bitcoin economy could potentially add 23.8 million people to its ranks, more than doubling the number of monthly active Bitcoin wallets.</p><h3><strong>Unlock New Network Effects to Drive Bitcoin’s Adoption</strong></h3><p>When gaming NFTs take off in the Bitcoin ecosystem, they could kickstart additional network effects that would, in turn, lead to deeper adoption for Bitcoin. For instance, a thriving gaming sector within the Bitcoin ecosystem may birth predictive markets and betting applications. Both gamers and non-gamers participating in the predictive markets could be rewarded in Bitcoin or other tokens in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/">STX</a>, based on game outcomes.</p><p>Similarly,&nbsp; a subculture of game streaming has grown over time and could become an important part of the Bitcoin gaming ecosystem too. Today, popular games often have large communities of people who watch other people play those games. For instance, the top three most-watched games on Twitch (Grand Theft Auto, League of Legends, and VALORANT) all have <a href="https://sullygnome.com/games/365/watched">more than 1 billion hours</a> of watch time in the last year alone.</p><p>If similar cultures of betting and streaming catches on with games built on Bitcoin, those additional markets could bring more businesses to Bitcoin, including advertisers and sponsors who want to capitalize on the attention in the space. Those advertising and sponsorship dollars in turn help legitimize the space and bring money in that then attracts more game developers to continue to innovate and build new games (and of course, new games bring new players).&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Enable Strategic Partnerships to Drive Adoption at Scale</strong></h3><p>Gaming NFTS could provide partnership opportunities for established brands to bring exposure to Bitcoin. We are already seeing this happen on other blockchains. For example, Sorare entered an <a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/la-liga-sorare-nft-digital-trading-cards-blockchain-spain-soccer/">NFT market partnership</a> with the Spanish LaLiga. These partnerships enable LaLiga to stay at the forefront of innovation. The Spanish league can now&nbsp; unlock a new revenue opportunity and reach their fans through a new channel, by selling highlights of games, jersey numbers, images, and more as NFTs.</p><p>Similarly, Dapper Labs, the company behind NBA Top Shot, also signed a <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nba-top-shot-maker-create-034520117.html">deal with LaLiga</a> to create NFT collectibles. Dapper Labs’ first partnership with the NBA has already<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/business/nba-top-shot-moments.html">generated $589M in sales</a> of video highlights and other digital items. And for the blockchain companies involved with bringing these partnerships to life, these partnerships are an opportunity to bring an NFT marketplace to millions of sports fans all over the world.</p><p>Beyond sports, other gaming enterprises have also started exploring partnerships that will enable them to bundle NFTs into their offerings. Ubisoft is already working on <a href="https://www.psu.com/news/ubisoft-will-start-adding-nfts-to-their-games-beginning-with-ghost-recon-breakpoint/">including NFTs in its Ghost Recon</a> title, and Konami is celebrating its Castlevania 35th anniversary with a <a href="https://www.psu.com/news/castlevania-35th-anniversary-is-being-celebrated-with-the-konami-memorial-nft-collection/">memorial NFT collection</a>.</p><p>By facilitating strategic partnerships, gaming NFTs can help drive Bitcoin’s adoption at scale by introducing existing fans to a new collectibles medium rather than trying to create a new fan base for a new game, entirely from scratch.</p><h2><strong>Start Building Gaming NFTs for Bitcoin</strong></h2><p>Bitcoin has remained the most dominant cryptocurrency for more than a decade. Its proven security, large market capitalization, and vibrant community provide a fertile ground for gaming NFTs to thrive, and in that thriving, gaming NFTs can help grow the entire Bitcoin economy.&nbsp;</p><p>At <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">Hiro</a>, we’ve created an extensive suite of developer tooling and resources to help you build for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

      name: "Improved Fee Estimations in the Hiro Wallet and Stacks API 🎯",
      "post-body":
        '<h2>What Are Transaction Fees and Fee Rates?</h2><p>A <strong><em>transaction fee</em></strong> is the amount of STX a user sends when submitting a transaction in order to incentivize miners to process it. The <strong><em>fee rate</em></strong> of a transaction is the fee per unit of the transaction’s “size”. The current Stacks node computes a transaction’s size using various parameters: its write count, write length, read count, read length, runtime, and size in number of bytes.</p><p>With a few exceptions, a default mining node considers transactions in order of fee rate, highest first. A higher (and thus more competitive) fee rate will increase the likelihood of a user’s transaction getting included in an upcoming block. This consideration grows more important in times of network congestion. However, a user also does not want to overpay. To avoid doing so, they must have a good sense of what a competitive transaction fee rate is <em>relative</em> to what others are paying on the network. This is why we built fee estimation features in the Stacks API and Hiro Wallet.</p><p>The fee estimation API endpoint analyzes historical transaction data to compute these estimates. There are three fee rate options available to a user: low, medium, and high. Each of these categories represents a specific percentile of the fee rates computed from looking at the transactions included in the past few blocks. Fee rates are ordered from smallest to largest and then estimates are set at the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles. The low estimate corresponds to the fifth percentile, medium corresponds to the fiftieth percentile, and high corresponds to the ninety-fifth percentile.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/62338083d9875b8a99af0f97_fee_rate_percentiles.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h2>A Healthy Fee Market</h2><p>Transaction fees are essential in a blockchain. They incentivize miners to process and include transactions in blocks, and prevent the occurrence of spam transactions in the network. As the network matures, we expect that users will pay higher transaction fees for time-sensitive transactions or do replace-by-fee to bump up the priority of their transactions. This competitive pricing naturally leads to the emergence of a robust fee market, which is a sign of a healthy blockchain network.</p><p>On the Stacks network, we have been seeing short bursts of high congestion, often centered around major contract launches. Fee markets can help soften these bursts. A user with a less urgent use case may be inclined to wait for the network to free up, to avoid having to pay high fees to ensure inclusion of their transaction in a block.</p><h2>The Nuts and Bolts</h2><p>This section will cover the technical details of our efforts on fee estimation. Skip ahead to <strong><em>Guidance for users</em></strong> if you aren’t concerned with implementation details!</p><h3>Past Work</h3><p>Those keeping a close eye on Hiro products may be aware that we rolled out a version of fee estimation back in November 2021. The Hiro Wallet presented estimates from an older version of the API endpoint. That API endpoint returned data from the fee estimator, which computed erroneously high fee estimates. This happened for two main reasons:</p><ol><li>Fee rates were not weighted by the size of the related transaction. Thus, STX transfers, which are minuscule by transaction size, had relatively huge fee rates, which greatly skewed fee rate estimates.</li><li>Outlier blocks disproportionately swung estimates. These blocks seemed to be mostly filled with STX transfers, which, as mentioned, had relatively high fee rates. In the initial fee estimator, we used exponential windowing to incorporate fee data from blocks, which allowed data from outlier blocks to persist for longer than desired.</li></ol><p>To read more about the reasons for the inaccurate estimates and see some relevant data, you can check out this <a href="https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain/issues/2954">GitHub issue</a>.</p><h3>How the Estimator Works &amp; Improvements</h3><p>As mentioned above, the fee estimate consists of three rates: a low, middle, and high estimate. Each of these corresponds to a certain percentile of observed fee rates (5, 50, and 95 respectively). After a block is mined, the miner notifies the fee estimator and provides it with a receipt of the block. This receipt has information about the included transactions and their execution costs. The fee estimator then updates its estimates for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile of fee rates based on this new data.</p><p>In the newer implementation of the fee estimator, we took special care to fix the issues seen in the past. Here are each of the modifications and related reasoning:</p><ol><li>If a Stacks block isn’t full, the fee estimator will “fill” the remaining block space with a dummy transaction that uses the minimum fee rate. This is done to account for the value of empty space. If blocks are often half-empty, a user wouldn’t want to match the fee rate of the occupied part of the block - they could use a lower fee rate and be fairly confident that there will be enough block space for their transactions to be included.</li><li>The fee rates are now weighted by transaction size during calculation. The relative size of the transaction is used to determine how much fee estimates should be affected by that fee rate. In practice, this means that heavier transactions with high fee rates have a greater chance of nudging the high estimate than the same number of light transactions with high fee rates.</li><li>Previously, the fee estimator used exponential decay for block data. In practice, this approach allowed outlier fee rates to impact fee estimates for longer than desired. In the new approach, the fee estimator computes estimates from data from the past 5 blocks by default, although the exact size of the window is configurable to miners.</li><li>When a user requests estimates, the fee estimator now returns a “fuzzed” version of the low, middle, and high estimate - some random noise is added to the baseline estimate. This is done to introduce some variation into the fee rates, to prevent the network converging on a single fee rate. This ensures that the fee rate dynamically adjusts according to network congestion levels. In periods of congestion, transactions that used the higher fee rates would be included in the next block, nudging the fee estimates up. As congestion clears, the transactions with lower estimates will also be included in the block, bringing the fee rate estimate back down again.</li></ol><h3>Future Improvements</h3><p>This work analyzes transactions in recent blocks to provide users with estimates for what a competitive fee rate might look like. However, in reality, a user’s competition is against the other transactions in the mempool, the group of unmined transactions that a miner considers in packaging its next block. Thus, future fee rate estimates may compute low, medium, and high estimates based on a transaction’s live competition by computing the fee rates of the transactions in the mempool itself.</p><h2>Guidance for Users</h2><h3>Improving the Hiro Wallet Experience</h3><p>The fee estimator work was included in the <a href="https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain/releases/tag/2.05.0.1.0">Stacks 2.05.0.1.0 blockchain release</a> in early February as well as the <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-wallet-web/releases/tag/v3.3.0">most recent release of the Hiro Wallet</a>.</p><p>From a user experience perspective, a more effective fee estimation protocol means that users will be able to better price their transactions. If they want to ensure their transaction is prioritized over other ones, using the “high” estimate will increase the likelihood their transaction will be confirmed more quickly. Effective fee estimations will give users more of an idea of the relative “attractiveness” of their transaction to miners, without users having to overspend to be confident in their transaction’s inclusion in the next block.</p><h3>Access Estimates Through the API</h3><p>Developers can access these estimates through the fee estimation API endpoint. The endpoint returns all three fee estimates: high, middle, and low. <a href="https://hirosystems.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#tag/Fees">Get started here</a>.</p>',

They need to be built on Bitcoin. In this post, I’ll share my thoughts on how Bitcoin has already created a thriving economy even with its limited capabilities. Then, I’ll explore how <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> expands the Bitcoin economy by enabling Bitcoin smart contracts that extend the value and functionality of the original blockchain by unlocking a myriad of new use cases.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Is the Bitcoin Economy?</strong></h2><p>As a currency, Bitcoin has recorded massive growth and adoption in the last decade. From the first known use-case of someone <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-pizza-day-celebrating-20-million-pizza-order/">buying a couple of pizzas for 10,000 BTC</a> to becoming adopted as a legal tender in El Salvador, Bitcoin has cemented a position as natively digital money.</p><p>Today, Bitcoin has a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">market cap of over $700 billion</a> (down from a recent high of $1.25 trillion), and it trades around $40,000. Yet, these impressive figures barely scratch the surface of what constitutes the Bitcoin economy.</p><p>The Bitcoin economy encompasses the market cap of Bitcoin, yes, but an entire economy exists around Bitcoin to make one person sending Bitcoin to another possible, including the software developers who maintain Bitcoin’s code, miners mining new Bitcoin blocks, nodes running the network, exchanges allowing users to trade, wallets to hold Bitcoin, and more.</p><p>And that list doesn’t even begin to touch on the possibilities of Bitcoin applications enabled by Stacks. I’ll get back to that later.</p><h2><strong>Unpacking the Components of the Bitcoin Economy&nbsp;</strong><br></h2><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6230cf62ab9d87850d47d4bc_economy_map.png" loading="lazy"></div></figure><p>There isn’t a single standard for defining the entire scope of the Bitcoin economy, so let’s take a look at some of the different components to give you a sense of just how active the Bitcoin community is today and why you should be excited about building applications for Bitcoin.</p><h3>Bitcoin Development</h3><p>Bitcoin was originally built by software developers, and there is still an active development community today. At its heart, the Bitcoin protocol has a community of committed contributors, organizations, non-profits, and foundations that maintain the source code and support network upgrades. Organizations such as <a href="https://brink.dev/">Brink</a> and <a href="https://chaincode.com/about">Chaincode Labs</a> support the Bitcoin protocol and network with research and development, education, and funding for innovators building for Bitcoin.</p><p>Contributions to Bitcoin development are permissionless, and any individual or team can contribute to Bitcoin. According to <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">Electric Capital’s 2021 Developer Report</a>, there are 680+ individual open-source developers working on Bitcoin, and Bitcoin consistently attracts more than 100 new developers into its dev community every month, serving as an educational launchpad for developers entering Web3 and crypto.</p><h3>Bitcoin Infrastructure</h3><p>The Bitcoin network processes about <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions">237,402 transactions per day</a>, and it relies on a network of miners who confirm transactions and mine new Bitcoin into circulation as well as a network of nodes that maintain the Bitcoin ledger.</p><p>In the last year, Bitcoin miners have earned a seven-day average of <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/miners-revenue">$40.4 million per day</a> in block rewards and transaction fees for maintaining the Bitcoin network. A whole subset of businesses are devoted to designing and manufacturing better mining hardware to maximize those rewards, and Bitcoin’s mining hashrate, a function of the computing power securing the network, has a <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate">seven-day average of 207.009 million TH/s</a> across the top <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/731416/market-share-of-mining-pools/">15 Bitcoin mining pools</a>.</p><p>Bitcoin also requires a network of nodes that maintain the Bitcoin ledger and decentralize the network. Between February 2021 and February 2022, Bitcoin’s reachable nodes grew by 57.91% to a total of <a href="https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/?days=365">15,223 reachable nodes</a> around the world.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin On-Ramp and Off-Ramp Solutions</h3><p>We’ve touched on all of the players who make Bitcoin possible. Now let’s talk about where users fit in. How does an individual buy Bitcoin? They need on-ramp and off-ramp solutions that provide ways for users to buy and sell Bitcoin, enabling the conversion into fiat and vice versa, as appropriate. Today, there are <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/">more than 300 crypto exchanges</a>, the majority of which enable Bitcoin trades. Those options range from centralized and regulated institutions like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> to decentralized peer-to-peer networks like <a href="https://bisq.network/">Bisq</a>.</p><p>As if 300 exchanges for a global currency weren’t enough, there are <a href="https://coinatmradar.com/charts/growth/">more than 35,000 Bitcoin ATMs</a> around the world where you can walk up and buy Bitcoin on the spot.</p><p>In addition to these on-ramps, I also want to highlight payment network processors and merchant solutions as well. For instance, <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network</a>’s work in enabling instant payments and settlements and <a href="https://liquid.net/">Liquid Network</a>’s solution for the settlement of Bitcoin-based assets also help to expand Bitcoin’s use in traditional finance.</p><h3>Bitcoin Wallets&nbsp;</h3><p>In the Bitcoin economy, wallets are fundamental to user identification and authentication when interacting with decentralized applications, and, of course, for hodling.</p><p>There is a long list of companies that offer different kinds of Bitcoin wallets, ranging from software wallets (including desktop wallets, mobile wallets, and browser extensions) to hardware wallets to facilitate cold storage of Bitcoin offline. Some of the major players include <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>, <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger</a>, <a href="https://www.exodus.com/">Exodus</a> and <a href="https://trezor.io/">Trezor</a>, and those wallets serve a lot of users.</p><p>Chainalysis reports that there were more than <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/bitcoin-addresses/">25 million</a> Bitcoin addresses associated with private wallets holding Bitcoin at the end of 2018, with another 147M addresses associated with service providers (exchanges, merchants, among others). In January 2022, <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=addresses.ActiveCount&resolution=1month&s=1230508800&u=1644796800&zoom=">16.5M addresses</a> were active (sending or receiving Bitcoin), according to Glassnode.</p><h3>Bitcoin Smart Contracts</h3><p>All of the statistics and companies I mentioned above represent a snapshot of where Bitcoin is today. Let’s talk about where the Bitcoin economy is going.</p><p>I have conviction in the long term, sustainable value of Bitcoin. It’s a revolutionary innovation and a uniquely valuable asset. But on its own, Bitcoin is not programmable, and it’s not a <em>productive</em> asset. Its limited scripting language is&nbsp; by design and increases its security and decentralization. However, you need that programmability to unleash Bitcoin’s full potential and unlock the rest of the Bitcoin economy. That’s where <a href="https://stacks.co/">Stacks</a> comes in.</p><p>Stacks lets you leverage Bitcoin’s amazing attributes - its unparallelled security and decentralization - without changing them. It makes Bitcoin a productive asset and a foundation for new decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Stacks brings fully expressive smart contracts to Bitcoin and does so through its <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/is-stacks-a-layer-1-or-layer-2">unique relationship with the original blockchain</a>.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Proof of Transfer (PoX)</strong>: Stacks uses a novel consensus mechanism that ties the Stacks blockchain to Bitcoin. The PoX design dictates that every Stacks transaction settles on Bitcoin, so Stacks inherits Bitcoin’s security and recycles its proof of work. Importantly, this consensus mechanism turns STX tokens into Bitcoin-yielding assets, introducing a powerful <a href="https://stacking.club/">new primitive</a>.</li><li><strong>Clarity</strong>: Stacks uses a new programming language called Clarity that is <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/smart-contracts-cant-afford-to-fail-and-with-clarity-language-they-wont">optimized for security and predictability</a>. Another unique and powerful attribute of Clarity is that it has visibility into Bitcoin’s global state, so developers can write smart contracts that react to native Bitcoin transactions. This is a key ingredient that makes Bitcoin programmable, enabling things like native swaps and on-chain Bitcoin lending.</li></ol><p>Today, Stacks has 120+ full time developers and dozens of entities, including us at <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">Hiro</a>, that are working to productize Bitcoin’s programmability and make it more accessible to developers, enabling a new wave of innovation. In fact, Stacks is the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/stacks-ecosystem-becomes-1-web3-project-on-bitcoin">largest and fastest-growing Web3 project on Bitcoin</a>.</p><h3>Bitcoin Applications</h3><p>Now that Bitcoin is programmable, developers can unlock the final pieces of the Bitcoin economy and build new applications for Bitcoin including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs and more. That innovation is already appearing on Stacks, and a new wave of developers are building the Bitcoin applications of tomorrow.</p><p>Since the launch of Stacks mainnet in January 2021, we’ve seen developers jumpstart amazing projects in DeFi. <a href="https://arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a> is leveraging Stacks’ Bitcoin-yielding primitive to pioneer self-repaying loans and the stablecoin USDA. <a href="https://www.alexgo.io/">ALEX</a> has built a decentralized exchange. <a href="https://www.zestprotocol.com/">Zest</a> is exploring undercollateralized on-chain Bitcoin loans.</p><p>This accelerating innovation can also be seen in Bitcoin NFTs. Numerous marketplaces, such as <a href="https://stxnft.com/">STXNFT</a> and <a href="https://byzantion.xyz/">Byzantion</a>, have provided over 4M STX trading volume to date for hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin NFTs.&nbsp; This new opportunity for one’s digital property to have provenance on the most secure blockchain, along with the ability to tap into Bitcoin’s trillion dollars of capital, has <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/nft-curious-bet-on-bitcoin-nfts-to-secure-your-digital-legacy">tremendous promise for creators and their fans</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We are even seeing entirely novel use cases being built on Bitcoin, such as <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/">CityCoins</a>, which gives communities the power to support their cities, and <a href="https://www.sigle.io/">Sigle</a>, a writing platform that lets writers earn BTC from readers without those readers spending their principal. And we’re just scratching the surface. I firmly believe that the newfound programmability that enables these innovative apps - as well as those yet to be seen - will be a critical driver of growth for the Bitcoin economy for years to come.</p><h2><strong>Stacks Helps You Build for the Bitcoin Economy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>If you believe Bitcoin is sound money and can be a global reserve currency, you need decentralized on and offramps in order to trade in and out of it while maintaining the ethos of trustlessness that makes Bitcoin so powerful. You need Bitcoin to become a productive asset. For that you need programmability. That’s where Stacks comes in.</p><p>Through Stacks, developers can build new applications for Bitcoin, a blockchain that has more capital than any other Web3 ecosystem, and one that is more likely than any other to stand the test of time. Bitcoin is a massive opportunity for builders, and Stacks provides the infrastructure for developers and entrepreneurs to leverage that opportunity.</p><p>Ready to build for Bitcoin? <a href="https://docs.hiro.so/">Start here.</a></p>',

      "post-body":
        '<p>The reason different approaches to consensus exist is because they all grapple with the blockchain trilemma: creating solutions that are <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-holds-the-secret-to-solving-the-trilemma-for-blockchain-platforms">simultaneously decentralized, secure, and scalable</a> is a very hard engineering problem. We in the Stacks community believe that the best approach to solving this problem lies with using Bitcoin as a secure foundation. Ultimately that’s why Stacks core developers created the Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism: to provide dApps with the security of the largest and most secure blockchain—Bitcoin—so they no longer have to bootstrap their own.</p><p>Stacks’ <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fcf9ac604d37418aa70a5ab/60072dbb32d416d6b3806935_5f1596b12bcc0800f3dcadcd_pox.pdf">PoX consensus mechanism</a> recycles Bitcoin’s existing Proof-of-Work computations to secure Stacks and periodically settles Stacks transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. To change the history of Stacks, you’d also have to change the history of Bitcoin. That means that Stacks inherits Bitcoin’s security.</p><h2><strong>What Is a Consensus Mechanism?</strong></h2><p>A consensus mechanism is how nodes in a network reach agreement with each other on what transactions have been validated. Blockchains are networks without a centralized authority, and with no authority to say “this is the truth about the state of things,” network nodes need another way to reach consensus.</p><p>Without a consensus mechanism, there can be no universally agreed upon ledger of transactions. New transactions can’t successfully be registered, invalid transactions might be recorded on-chain, and users’ assets on the blockchain won’t be secure.</p><p>Blockchains broadly achieve consensus by requiring their nodes to dedicate some resources to validate and secure new transactions. Here are the two most common consensus mechanisms:</p><h3><strong>Proof-of-Work Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3><p>In <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/proof-of-work-pow-consensus/">PoW</a>, a subset of nodes called “miners” dedicate computational resources to secure new blocks. Generally, those computational resources are put towards solving mathematical problems for a chance to validate transactions and earn a block reward. Bitcoin is the most popular example of a PoW chain.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Process</strong>: The miner who solves the math problem first gets to add the next block to the blockchain, securing the current state of the ledger, and earning the block rewards.</li><li><strong>Incentives</strong>: Miners are incentivized to act in the best interests of the blockchain because they would waste electricity and computational resources if they tried to act maliciously to execute attacks (such as double spend attacks, empty block attacks, or blockchain reorganization), and they would forgo the block rewards.</li><li><strong>Criticisms</strong>: One of the common criticisms is PoW’s environmental impact due to the amount of energy it requires to solve the computational problems. If Bitcoin were a country, it would be one of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952">top 30 countries consuming the most electricity</a>.</li></ul><h3><strong>Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3><p>In <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/30/what-is-proof-of-stake/">PoS</a>, miners dedicate financial resources to secure the blockchain. In this model, miners stake tokens to the network in exchange for a chance to validate transactions and earn a reward. Polkadot and Cardano are two popular PoS blockchains, and Ethereum is in the process of migrating from PoW to PoS.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Process</strong>: Validators propose blocks to be added, and the blockchain randomly selects a cohort of validators to secure the new block.</li><li><strong>Incentives</strong>: Validators are rewarded with block rewards when they validate blocks. Nodes can report other nodes acting maliciously (such as being unavailable, signing multiple blocks simultaneously, or trying to introduce bias into the randomness of the validation selection). Malicious nodes get a <a href="https://novuminsights.com/post/slashing-penalties-the-long-term-evolution-of-proof-of-stake-pos/">slashing penalty</a> that reduces their stake or revokes their validator status.</li><li><strong>Criticisms</strong>: One of the common criticisms with PoS is that validators with large stakes could gain excessive influence on the network. This is because in a PoS model, “the rich get richer,” and larger stakes lead to larger rewards. Other criticisms include the <a href="https://medium.com/@abhisharm/understanding-proof-of-stake-through-its-flaws-part-2-nothing-s-at-stake-8d12d826956c">Nothing-at-Stake problem</a>, where there is no opportunity cost for validators to stake on competing versions of the blockchain to maximize their rewards, as well as the lack of forks. Forks effectively act as a self-correcting mechanism allowing the network to recover from all sorts of potential issues. Without them, if a PoS network is ever overtaken by colluding miners, the rest of the network doesn’t have any recourse.</li></ul><p>Beyond PoW and PoS, there are other consensus mechanisms used on other blockchains. The main difference in how blockchains achieve consensus is dependent on the tradeoffs they are willing to make across the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-holds-the-secret-to-solving-the-trilemma-for-blockchain-platforms">trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Recycling PoW to Secure New Blockchains: From Proof-of-Burn to Proof-of-Transfer</strong></h2><p>Blockchains don’t scale easily because they have limited blockspace. And as they become widely adopted, demand for blockspace outstrips supply. One option for increasing the scalability of blockchains is to simply create more blockchains. More blockchains, more blockspace to go around.&nbsp;</p><p>The question in that scenario then becomes: can we secure new blockchains by leveraging the computational and financial resources already spent in other blockchains? This would address scalability without creating new environmental problems and without creating security issues as you try to bootstrap decentralization from scratch.</p><p>In the context of PoW, here are two solutions to recycle the “work” of a different blockchain to secure a new one, reducing the environmental impact of PoW.</p><h3><strong>Proof-of-Burn Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-burn-cryptocurrency.asp">PoB</a> is a consensus mechanism layered on PoW to enable miners to participate in the consensus protocol without having to set up mining rigs. Instead, the miners “burn” the tokens of a PoW chain by sending them to an address that verifiably cannot spend the tokens, taking them out of circulation forever.</p><ul><li><strong>Process:</strong> Miners participate in the consensus process by burning the tokens of one blockchain to have the chance to mine new blocks in a different one. Miners can increase their chances of being selected by increasing the number of tokens burned.</li><li><strong>Incentives:</strong> The miners are rewarded in the tokens of the new blockchain when they are chosen to mine a new block. Because the miners burn tokens for a chance to mine a block, they have “skin in the game” and are incentivized to act in the best interests of the network. Their burned tokens are wasted if the blockchain becomes insecure in the wake of malicious activity.</li><li><strong>Criticisms:</strong> One of the major criticisms of PoB is that it is wasteful in the same way that PoW is wasteful: the tokens burned in PoB are gone forever. Additionally, the process of burning coins is opaque and can be hard to verify, and we have yet to see a successful PoB blockchain achieve meaningful scale.</li></ul><h3><strong>Proof of Transfer Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3><p><a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5fcf9ac604d37418aa70a5ab/60072dbb32d416d6b3806935_5f1596b12bcc0800f3dcadcd_pox.pdf">PoX</a> is a new consensus mechanism designed and developed by Stacks as a way to secure a new blockchain by recycling the PoW computation of an existing blockchain. Similar to PoB, miners send tokens (BTC in the case of Stacks) to a series of addresses determined by the consensus mechanism. However, unlike PoB those addresses belong to users, as a reward for users locking up their tokens for network stability. Rather than tokens being <em>burned</em> and taken out of circulation, they are <em>transferred</em> to users in the network.</p><ul><li><strong>Process:</strong> Miners transfer BTC for the chance to validate a block. The blockchain selects a winner using a weighted random function in which the chance of winning the block is proportional to the amount of BTC transferred relative to other miners.</li><li><strong>Incentives:</strong> For validating a block, miners receive newly-minted STX tokens and the transaction fees for that block. Similar to PoB, miners are incentivized to avoid malicious behavior because undermining the blockchain would lead to the loss of the transferred BTC.</li><li><strong>Criticisms</strong>: One criticism of PoX is that it is possible for miners to “discount mine,” in which they mine new blocks while simultaneously stacking tokens as a network participant. Through that process, miners could earn rewards as both a miner and network participant. This could theoretically encourage miner consolidation, but we have yet to see that occur in practice.</li></ul><h2><strong>What Does Proof of Transfer Mean for Developers?</strong></h2><p>PoX is a novel consensus mechanism that enables some unique benefits. By connecting two different blockchains through PoX, developers can leverage the strengths of different blockchains while avoiding their weaknesses, and in the process build user experiences that can’t exist in other types of consensus and bootstrap their growth more quickly.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>You Can Build Secure Web3 Apps</strong></h3><p>PoX eliminates the difficult choice between programmability and security when developers want to pick an underlying blockchain for their Web3 apps. Bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized blockchain, but its design does not allow for smart contracts. This makes it difficult to build decentralized applications on Bitcoin, and many developers who would have loved to build their application on Bitcoin often chose less secure chains out of necessity. With PoX, developers can now build applications on a programmable blockchain (Stacks) that then settle on the more decentralized blockchain (Bitcoin) and benefit from Bitcoin’s security.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>You Can Accelerate User Adoption&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Through PoX , developers can accelerate user adoption because users can earn rewards in a more established cryptocurrency. You can de-risk the user’s decision to participate in consensus because Bitcoin is less risky than a brand new token that has not yet proven its worth and may make participation more appealing to the general public. Developers can also leverage PoX to build novel incentivization structures. For instance, <a href="https://arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a> uses PoX to create self-repaying loans, and <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/about">CityCoins</a> uses PoX to create city-specific currencies to help communities support local governments.</p><h3><strong>You Promote Democratized Access</strong></h3><p>PoX enhances democratized access to blockchains and blockchain-powered applications because anyone can be a miner without needing to invest in expensive mining equipment or having in-depth DevOps experience. All that is required to participate in the consensus process on a PoX chain is to send some tokens to an address. Secondly PoX, democratizes access by being user-verifiable: anyone can easily verify the state of the blockchain. Democratization and open-access are core to the ethos of Web3. PoX embraces that, and developers can use these same properties to build apps with open access.</p><h2><strong>How Does Stacks’ Proof of Transfer Consensus Mechanism Work?</strong></h2><p>Stacks delivers fully expressive smart contracts secured by Bitcoin without modifying Bitcoin’s core. Simply put, PoX enables Bitcoin applications. Here’s how it works.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img alt="image.png" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/62279f7b88b0f924dbe35310_oV331ey4UU6D2VMXwy_-0avpOsnmFK7TffFVT30QRJKDAh2sOEABVzKlmoTuGXMPkX9MtKm6FYJR5nGa7z7rXIEfGU_XS3zWrExrM2BYXaX_pBHbBV5djVljR68ho9XsXNqYaDmb.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.stacks.co/learn/features#:~:text=Proof%20of%20Transfer%20(PoX)%20is,powers%20without%20modifying%20Bitcoin%20itself"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>PoX is designed to be open access, so that anyone can participate. To participate in PoX, miners transfer BTC to predefined addresses that correspond to the address of Stackers (more on them in a moment) for a chance to mine the next Stacks block. The consensus rules select the winning miner using a verifiable random function (VRF) to ensure true randomness. The successful miner, in turn, writes the next block of the Stacks blockchain and receives the block rewards and the transaction fees from that block paid out in newly minted STX tokens, the gas token for the Stacks network.&nbsp;</p><p>Stacks users can also participate in the consensus mechanism through a process called “<a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet-faq/how-does-stacking-work">Stacking</a>.” Users can lock up their Stacks (STX) tokens during a Stacking cycle, which lasts two weeks. By stacking STX, users signal support that the Stacks network is reliably functional and <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/802d25994721d88ab7c7991bde88b0a9#file-how-stacking-helps-the-network-md">sufficiently stable</a> to encourage miners to participate in PoX. Stackers, in turn, are eligible to receive a prorated share of the BTC committed by the miners during the Stacking cycle.</p><p>The rewards incentivize economically rational users to stack their tokens. Stacking the tokens takes them out of circulation to add more value to the network, and more token holders rely on the increasing value to expand their participation in the network.</p><h2><strong>Ready to Build on Stacks?</strong></h2><p>We spent years in research and development to design the Proof of Transfer mechanism. It is what enables Stacks’ connection to Bitcoin and what we believe will accelerate its adoption. Now that you have an idea of how PoX leverages Bitcoin to secure the Stacks blockchain, are you ready to build applications for Bitcoin?</p><p><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/"><strong>Get Started</strong></a><br></p>',

      name: "How to Use NFT Endpoints in the Stacks API",
      "post-body":
        '<p>NFTs have taken the crypto world by storm, and in the past 6 months, we’ve seen interest in Bitcoin NFTs on Stacks skyrocket:</p><ul><li>7 organic marketplaces emerged</li><li>140,000+ NFTs minted</li><li>&gt;4M STX volume traded</li><li>Top NFT series are up 10-50X<br></li></ul><p>The Stacks community has embraced Bitcoin NFTs as a way to own part of <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/what-is-bitcoin-culture-see-it-through-bitcoin-nfts">Bitcoin culture</a>, and Hiro has made it easier for Stacks developers to capitalize on that interest and build new applications around NFTs by adding new NFT endpoints to the Stacks API. Those endpoints include:<br></p><ol><li>Non-Fungible Token holdings</li><li>Non-Fungible Token history</li><li>Non-Fungible Token mints<br></li></ol><p>Let’s dive into each endpoint and explore what you can do with them.</p><h2>Non-Fungible Token holdings</h2><p>This endpoint can retrieve all of the NFTs owned by a specific STX address or by a smart contract ID. For example, if you want to get all NFTs owned by the STX address SP3BK1NNSWN719Z6KDW05RBGVS940YCN6X84STYPR you would call this URL:</p><p><a href="https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/tokens/nft/holdings?principal=SP3BK1NNSWN719Z6KDW05RBGVS940YCN6X84STYPR">https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/tokens/nft/holdings?principal=SP3BK1NNSWN719Z6KDW05RBGVS940YCN6X84STYPR</a>‍</p><p>Once called, the API response will look something like:</p><div></div><p>As you can see in the sample response, the endpoint returns all of the NFT assets held by that address. In this case, the user owns 4 NFTs, including a BNS name, as well as NFTs from Project Indigo, Wasteland Apes, and Crashpunks.<br></p><p>These results can also be filtered by one or more asset identifiers (such as the name of the NFT collection) and can be configured to include metadata about each asset transaction (such as the STX price the user paid for each NFT).<br></p><p>Developers can use this endpoint to confirm whether a user holds a specific NFT. With that information, developers can create whitelists or gated access to specific app features, based on whether the user holds an NFT from a particular collection.<br></p><p>This endpoint also enables developers to build user profiles that show off the user’s NFT portfolio. For example, a NFT marketplace might create these user profiles to foster a stronger sense of community. These public profiles would allow users to display their NFT collection and select a profile picture from among the NFTs in their collection.<br></p><p>To learn more about the available request parameters and response fields for this endpoint, visit <a href="https://docs.hiro.so/api#operation/get_nft_holdings">https://docs.hiro.so/api#operation/get_nft_holdings</a>.</p><h2>Non-Fungible Token history</h2><p>Through this endpoint, you can pull all events and transactions that affected a particular NFT. This is useful for developers who want to look at the ownership history of a particular asset. For example, to get the history of The Explorer Guild NFT #2051, you would call this URL:<br></p><p><a href="https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/tokens/nft/history?asset_identifier=SP2X0TZ59D5SZ8ACQ6YMCHHNR2ZN51Z32E2CJ173.the-explorer-guild%3A%3AThe-Explorer-Guild&value=0x0100000000000000000000000000000803">https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/tokens/nft/history?asset_identifier=SP2X0TZ59D5SZ8ACQ6YMCHHNR2ZN51Z32E2CJ173.the-explorer-guild%3A%3AThe-Explorer-Guild&amp;value=0x0100000000000000000000000000000803</a>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Note how the NFT "value" (2051 in this case) has to be encoded into its Clarity hex representation. Once called, the API response will look something like:</p><div></div><p>The endpoint then retrieves a list of all events that affected this NFT. In this example, you can see both a mint and transfer to marketplace event in the “asset_event_type”. This endpoint can also retrieve transfers to owners, as well as relevant details for each event, such as listing and purchase prices.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With this data, developers can build price charts for specific NFTs, monitor trading activity, and more.<br></p><p>To learn more about the available request parameters and response fields for this endpoint, visit <a href="https://docs.hiro.so/api#operation/get_nft_history">https://docs.hiro.so/api#operation/get_nft_history</a>.</p><h2>Non-Fungible Token mints</h2><p>This endpoint can help developers identify which NFTs of a particular collection have been minted, and by whom. For example, if you want to get the last 3 NFTs minted from the Megapont Ape collection, you would call this URL: </p><p>‍<a href="https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/tokens/nft/mints?asset_identifier=SP3D6PV2ACBPEKYJTCMH7HEN02KP87QSP8KTEH335.megapont-ape-club-nft%3A%3AMegapont-Ape-Club&limit=3">https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/tokens/nft/mints?asset_identifier=SP3D6PV2ACBPEKYJTCMH7HEN02KP87QSP8KTEH335.megapont-ape-club-nft%3A%3AMegapont-Ape-Club&amp;limit=3</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Once called, the API response will look something like:</p><div></div><p>This code retrieves the mint history from a specific NFT collection, including optional data about each event such as the price for minting and any fees incurred.<br></p><p>With this information, developers can figure out how many NFT mints are remaining in a new collection, get a list of all addresses that participated in the mint, find out which address minted the most of a particular collection, and more.<br></p><p>To learn more about the available request parameters and response fields for this endpoint, visit <a href="https://docs.hiro.so/api#operation/get_nft_mints">https://docs.hiro.so/api#operation/get_nft_mints</a>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We’re eager to see what you can build with these endpoints!

        '<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been called the <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-defi-wild-west-crypto-51635526163">“Wild West” of cryptocurrency</a>. DeFi extends the power of blockchain technology to provide a full-fledged digital alternative to Wall Street, banks, and exchanges, all without controlling authorities charging exorbitant fees. It takes the idea of decentralization to the heart of the economic system: finance. And in the past year, DeFi has exploded in popularity.</p>',
      name: "Bitcoin Economy: The Challenges of Bitcoin DeFi and How Stacks Addresses Them",
      "post-body":
        '<p>According to <a href="https://defillama.com/">DeFiLlama</a> statistics, the<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-is-total-value-locked-2021-09-29"> total value locked (TVL)</a> across layer-1 protocols increased by 1,189% from $18.7 billion at the start of 2021 to $240.96 billion by the end. With new money flowing into DeFi, developers are expanding its possibilities to new use cases and ecosystems, including bringing DeFi to the original blockchain itself: Bitcoin.</p><h2><strong>Three Main Challenges of Bitcoin DeFi</strong></h2><p>As of February 2022, Bitcoin’s market cap is over $700B on CoinMarketCap, yet the amount of Bitcoin being utilized in DeFi is <a href="https://www.defipulse.com/btc">only $12.5B</a>. The sheer amount of latent capital locked in the Bitcoin ecosystem is drawing the attention of DeFi developers from around the world. Now, with <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin, developers can unlock the full potential of DeFi for the Bitcoin ecosystem. But this surge of interest in Bitcoin DeFi comes with challenges.</p><h3><strong>1. Scalability&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Scalability simply refers to a cryptocurrency\'s capacity to handle a high number of transactions. For any cryptocurrency to gain widespread adoption (and for DeFi to succeed in that ecosystem), the network will need to be able to manage millions of users.<br></p><p>That becomes challenging when every transaction recorded on the blockchain is public, and all of the independent nodes in the network must agree on what transactions happened and when. This scaling challenge is known as the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-holds-the-secret-to-solving-the-trilemma-for-blockchain-platforms">blockchain trilemma</a>. To put that into perspective, Bitcoin can only handle <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/cryptocurrency/top-cryptocurrencies-with-their-high-transaction-speeds/#:~:text=If%20we%20talk%20about%20the%20Bitcoin%20network%2C%20the%20average%20confirmation%20time%20for%20a%20BTC%20payment%20is%20approximately%2010%20minutes%2C%20and%20it%20can%20process%20a%20maximum%20of%207%20transactions%20per%20second.">seven transactions per second</a> (TPS), the lowest of any well-known blockchain and a stark comparison to a legacy centralized company like Visa, which boasts an average of <a href="https://phemex.com/blogs/what-is-transactions-per-second-tps#:~:text=1%2C700%20transactions%20per%20second%20on%20average">1,700 TPS</a>.<br></p><p>When developers are considering building DeFi applications like decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, automated market makers, and everything in between, network scalability is one of the first major challenges for Bitcoin DeFi.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2. Security</strong></h3><p>Another big challenge in DeFi is security. Money lost to DeFi hacks more than doubled to $1.3B in 2021, according to <a href="https://certik-2.hubspotpagebuilder.com/the-state-of-defi-security-2021">CertiK’s 2021 State of DeFi Security</a>. Given how much money is flowing through DeFi applications, it’s not surprising that enterprising hackers want to exploit any bugs they find.<br></p><p>While the $1.3B figure looks big, and doubling the money lost sounds bad, this data can actually be considered an improvement. In 2020, the total value of hacked funds represented 2.78% of the total funds locked in DeFi, whereas in 2021, that was just 0.5%. In other words, hackers were able to steal a smaller slice of the DeFi pie in 2021 than they were the year prior. As hackers exploit bugs, developers learn from them and patch them, improving security over time.<br></p><p>While Bitcoin’s script itself may be secure from hacks and has stood the test of time, the same isn’t true for Bitcoin DeFi, a much newer economy. Given Bitcoin DeFi is in its infancy, with a <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/smart-contracts-cant-afford-to-fail-and-with-clarity-language-they-wont">new programming language</a> to boot, Bitcoin DeFi must learn from other battle-tested DeFi protocols and incorporate the latest security measures available in the ecosystem. Developers have to anticipate DeFi attack vectors and write new code to meet those challenges head on. With that innovation comes some degree of trial and error.</p><h3><strong>3. Composability</strong></h3><p>In contrast to traditional financial systems locked behind firewalls, DeFi is open, transparent, and decentralized. For a DeFi ecosystem to succeed, DeFi apps inside that ecosystem need to be composable, meaning that different applications all use certain coding standards, or primitives, that allow them to interact with each other and also allow different smart contracts to be combined like lego blocks into entirely new use cases.<br></p><p>The challenge here when it comes to Bitcoin DeFi is that Bitcoin’s scripting language is extremely limited. This means that Bitcoin has small attack vectors and is incredibly secure and decentralized, but it also means that Bitcoin can’t do much else besides peer-to-peer transactions.<br></p><p>Want to build a Bitcoin lending protocol? A decentralized automated market maker? A stablecoin? You can’t build these standard DeFi applications on Bitcoin because Bitcoin’s script is too limited.</p><blockquote>You can’t write the individual smart contracts that would compose Bitcoin DeFi because Bitcoin doesn’t have smart contract functionality. In fact, you need a second blockchain altogether to make Bitcoin DeFi possible.</blockquote><h2><strong>The Benefits of Using Stacks Blockchain for Bitcoin DeFi</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> enables smart contracts for Bitcoin, and within the Stacks ecosystem, developers have demonstrated that <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-defi-is-here-a-deep-dive-into-trust-less-swaps">Bitcoin DeFi is possible</a>. Stacks has a <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/is-stacks-a-layer-1-or-layer-2">unique relationship</a> to Bitcoin that enables real Bitcoin DeFi to flourish. Here are the benefits of building Bitcoin DeFi on Stacks.</p><h3><strong>Provides Programmability</strong></h3><p>One of the limitations mentioned above was Bitcoin\'s limited scripting language. While Bitcoin is not easily programmable, it is secure and reliable as a decentralized store of value. Stacks unleashes Bitcoin through <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-ecosystem-a-guide-to-programming-languages-for-bitcoin-smart-contracts">Clarity</a>, a new programming language that brings smart contracts to Bitcoin.<br></p><p>Through Clarity, developers can deploy smart contracts on top of Bitcoin without changing Bitcoin\'s scripting language. Importantly, Stacks’ smart contracts can interact with Bitcoin’s global state and on-chain data, meaning you can create DeFi apps that react to native Bitcoin transactions.</p><h3><strong>Increases Scalability</strong></h3><p>Bitcoin only processes seven transactions per second compared to <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/scaling-ethereum-crypto-for-a-billion-users-715ce15afc0b#:~:text=Ethereum%27s%20decentralized%20design%20ends%20up,high%20as%20%24200%20per%20transaction.">Ethereum\'s 15</a>. Stacks provides a solution to that scalability problem by enabling transactions to occur outside of Bitcoin, and then settling those transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes with the mining of a new Bitcoin block.<br></p><p>To bring improved scalability for Bitcoin DeFi, the Stacks ecosystem has taken on a number of new initiatives to scale the network, including <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/microblocks-reduce-transaction-processing-times">microblocks</a>, <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/jude-nelson-on-scaling-stacks-with-appchains">appchains</a>, and <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/introducing-hyperchains-by-hiro">hyperchains by Hiro</a>. These improvements will allow Bitcoin DeFi to scale from thousands to millions of users.</p><h3><strong>Introduces Security Through Proof of Transfer</strong></h3><p>The Stacks blockchain was created so developers can benefit from Bitcoin\'s decentralization and security without changing Bitcoin itself. <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/proof-of-transfer">Proof of Transfer</a> (PoX) is Stacks’ unique consensus mechanism that connects two blockchains (in this case, Bitcoin and Stacks). Importantly, all Stacks transactions settle on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means that the Stacks network benefits from Bitcoin’s security and decentralization. To change the history of Stacks, you also have to change the history of Bitcoin—and don’t forget, Bitcoin is the most decentralized and secure blockchain in existence today. Full stop.</p><blockquote>Bitcoin is the most decentralized and secure blockchain in existence today. Full stop.<br></blockquote><p>Proof of Transfer also unlocks a powerful new DeFi primitive: stacking. Users can lock up their Stacks tokens to stabilize the Stacks network and earn rewards, paid in BTC. As of January 2022, users locked $1B USD in a smart contract for Stacking, with 100+ BTC in monthly rewards being paid to stackers. Additionally, Bitcoin DeFi applications can use stacking and proof of transfer to enable all kinds of interesting use cases, such as self-repaying loans and generating yield in a different asset than the collateral.</p><h3><strong>Creates Composability</strong></h3><p>One of the unique features of the programming language Clarity is that the source for every single Clarity contract is publicly readable on the blockchain. This effectively makes the Stacks blockchain a “GitHub” for Clarity contracts, where developers can look at the code of other smart contracts and even use that code for a new application.<br></p><p>Unlike other smart contract languages in which users have to take a leap of faith, Clarity enables developers (and users) to confirm that a smart contract’s code is unaltered from the source code.</p><h2><strong>Pioneers in Bitcoin DeFi</strong></h2><p>A burgeoning group of developers is creating cutting-edge technologies on the Stacks blockchain to make Bitcoin Defi a reality. Want to meet a few of them?&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Hiro Wallet</strong></h3><p>While interacting with the Stacks blockchain, <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet">Hiro Wallet</a> provides a secure method to manage STX tokens, sign in to decentralized apps, and protect users’ assets. The Hiro Wallet is the most popular wallet in the Stacks ecosystem, but there are other options for users, including theBoom Wallet, Neptune Wallet, and Xverse Wallet.</p><h3><strong>ALEX</strong></h3><p><a href="https://alexgo.io/">ALEX</a> is the first open-source decentralized exchange built on Stacks, complete with an automated market maker and order-book. ALEX also helps other projects bootstrap their token launches with the ALEX launchpad.</p><h3><strong>Arkadiko</strong></h3><p><a href="https://arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a> offers self-repaying loans on Stacks. Users can collateralize their STX tokens and borrow USDA coins. This stablecoin allows additional liquidity for Bitcoin DeFi in the form of a soft-pegged U.S. dollar stablecoin while keeping the user’s original asset exposure.</p><h3><strong>Zest Protocol</strong></h3><p>The newest addition to Bitcoin DeFi, <a href="https://www.zestprotocol.com/">Zest Protocol</a>, announced just a few weeks ago, aims to provide undercollateralized Bitcoin loans to institutional borrowers and bring the $130 trillion bond market on-chain.</p><h2><strong>Looking to the Future of Bitcoin DeFi</strong></h2><p>Stacks helps overcome the challenges of Bitcoin DeFi, including scalability, security, and composability, allowing developers to innovate and build new financial applications on top of Bitcoin, all without altering Bitcoin itself. At Hiro, we create developer tools for Stacks, so you can build DeFi applications for Bitcoin. <a href="https://docs.hiro.so/">Ready to get started</a>?</p>',

      name: "Introducing Hyperchains by Hiro",
      "post-body":
        '<h2><strong>Enabling “Hyper” Growth on Stacks</strong><br></h2><p>The Stacks blockchain architecture makes deliberate design choices that optimize for a decentralized, permission-less environment. In particular, the protocol prioritizes two integral traits that decentralize the ecosystem: <strong>open membership</strong> (anyone can become a miner) and <strong>user verifiable</strong> (anyone can validate the state of the Stacks blockchain).<br></p><p>However, one side-effect of those design choices is that the Stacks architecture is not great for certain workloads, namely those that require high throughput and low latency. Even after the network upgrade in December, we have seen high congestion and <a href="https://stacksdata.info/#mempool">bursty behavior around major NFT launches</a>. The community is growing—this is a great problem to have!<br></p><p>In just one year since the launch of mainnet, Stacks has become the largest and fastest-growing Web3 project on Bitcoin. It’s clear we need scalability solutions, and we believe in giving developers (and users) choice, by making opt-in systems with explicit trade-offs.<br></p><p>Rather than loosening these “<a href="https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain/discussions/2974">decentralization axioms</a>” for the entire network, Hiro is working on an open-source solution called hyperchains, a new scalability layer designed for flexibility and experimentation that will enable hypergrowth on the decentralized Stacks network. Like many other Hiro products, hyperchains will be built and maintained by the Hiro team and made available under an open source license and will be open to community contributions.</p><blockquote>Hiro is working on an open-source solution called hyperchains, a new scalability layer designed for flexibility and experimentation that will enable hypergrowth on the decentralized Stacks network.<br></blockquote><p>Hyperchains trade decentralization for performance, allowing users to deposit assets into a hyperchain to benefit from that improved performance and later withdraw those assets out to the more decentralized Stacks main chain when they’re done. At a high level, here’s how hyperchains and the Stacks blockchain will interact with each other: </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/62166d64891288a883dd6110_hyperchains_overview.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>We favor a design that allows for multiple hyperchains with different consensus rules, trust assumptions, and use cases that range from general to application-specific. Our proposed design also allows multiple hyperchains to simultaneously coexist on the Stacks chain, giving users optionality in which hyperchain (and which level of decentralization) they want to participate in. Our <a href="https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain/discussions/2974">GitHub conversation</a> has more protocol level information if you want to learn more about hyperchains.<br></p><h2><strong>Use Cases for Hyperchains</strong></h2><p>Hyperchains are designed for workloads that require high throughput and low latency. From our perspective, there are a few specific use cases for hyperchains that come to mind.<br></p><p>We believe that NFT launches, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and collectible games will benefit from hyperchains. What these examples have in common is that they trigger a high volume of time-sensitive transactions. A delay could mean the difference between minting an NFT or missing out altogether, between executing a critical trade at the right time or the wrong one, or between hitting an all-time score or letting your competitors best you.<br></p><p>That high volume of transactions requires low latency (the time it takes to process data) for a good user experience. Simply put, hyperchains will enable these applications to process transactions faster.</p><blockquote>Say goodbye to wait times for thousands of users, and say hello to instant settlement for millions.<br></blockquote><p>Of course, there are a myriad of future use cases we haven’t imagined yet, and we embrace that innovation too! We look forward to seeing the creativity of Stacks developers as they experiment with the hyperchains MVP later this year. As mentioned, <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-hyperchains">the code is open source</a>, and anyone will be able to iterate off Hiro’s version to explore new ideas.</p><h2><strong>The Road to a Hyperchains MVP</strong><br></h2><p>Hyperchains will involve multiple phases of development, from MVP to feature-rich implementations in the future. Each step will test out scaling solutions to support the continued growth of Stacks.<br></p><p>For the very first hyperchains MVP, we’re starting with a trusted approach and plan to gradually open up hyperchains to increasing levels of decentralization. You can follow and bookmark our <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-subnets">repo</a> to track the action.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/62166b8ff2d36478383bb139_hyperchains_roadmap.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>The goal for Milestone 0 [M0] is to build a minimum end-to-end testable version that ingests a Stacks event stream, uses it to download hyperchain blocks from peers or validate pushed blocks, and responds over the RPC interface. We are on target to have this ready for the end of February.</p><p>The next key milestone M1 is expected in April 2022 and will allow users to spin up a local instance for testing. At this phase, we plan to support committing hyperchain blocks to the Stacks chain, as well as reading commitments out of the Stacks chain using the actual event listener interface. While this iteration won’t be able to test withdrawals and deposits yet, it will provide the ability to interact with the Hyperchain and peek under the hood.</p><p>This stage will also be a key point for us to bring in our enthusiastic early adopters and gather early feedback. We will share more details on what to expect at this milestone and ways to join the previews in the coming weeks.</p><p>Milestone 2 [M2] introduces multi-party trust: miner commitments must be signed by a coalition of participants. Block assembly will require passing proposals between participants.</p><p>At Milestone 3 [M3], hyperchain contracts will be capable of deposits, withdrawals, and mints.</p><p>Finally, as part of our testing and documentation plan for the hyperchains MVP, we plan to launch a case study either involving a DEX or an NFT launch, working in collaboration with developers from the Stacks ecosystem to test the very first marketplace on hyperchains. <br></p><h2><strong>What’s Next </strong><br></h2><p>While our current focus for MVP is a federated model, we have plans for evolving the hyperchains design to an ideal fully trustless model. The rollout of MVP should provide us with valuable feedback and observations to iteratively add to the Hyperchains experience.</p><p>Watch for periodic updates at each of the milestones as we race to build our MVP! If you’re craving more action, please chime in on the <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-hyperchains">GitHub conversation</a> and watch Aaron\'s <a href="https://youtu.be/GXOuRA011MA">talk on hyperchains</a> from the Bitcoin Innovation Summit.

The first Wrapped token was Wrapped Ethereum, and when it came to using Ethereum in smart contracts, the problem was that you couldn't really account for Ethereum in the same way you did other ERC-20 tokens. And so there was a need for a smart contract that would basically hold Ethereum and then mint Wrapped Ethereum as an ERC-20, so it could go back and forth between DeFi apps.</p><p>Wrapped assets are super helpful for interoperability and are how you connect L1 tokens with DeFi. On the Stacks network, we're helping bridge Bitcoin into xBTC by wrapping it. And so now you have xBTC as a token on the Stacks network, and you can connect that xBTC to all the DeFi applications that people are building, whether they're doing loans, AMMs, and things like that.</p><h5>Kyle:</h5><p>Chiente, I'm coming to you next on this. Mason starts talking about DeFi ecosystems on Stacks. You're a part of that, you've been helping to co-lead DeFi with a few other projects. Talk to us about your view coming from the DeFi ecosystem on Stacks and what this means for you guys.</p><h5>Chiente:</h5><p>xBTC is crucial to provide direct exposure to Bitcoin on a decentralized exchange. And the first question many people would ask is, \"Why do you need a Wrapped Bitcoin?\" xBTC is needed because although Stacks relies on Bitcoin as a settlement layer, Bitcoin does not rely on Stacks. It is impossible to make a change to the state of Bitcoin from Stacks. As Muneeb taught me, you don't want to do that in the first place. Bitcoin is the ultimate sound money. You don’t want to change that, right?</p><p>So in order to use Bitcoin on Stacks, we require a wrapped solution to provide greater utility. And with Tokensoft, our tech partner, and Anchor, the custodian, the xBTC token is created, and it's kept one to one to BTC value. This is very, very important. Without xBTC, I don't think that DeFi, including apps like ALEX, have any purpose to be on Stacks.</p><h5>Muneeb:</h5><p>I want to give a little bit of background context here. I think it's a very natural question that a lot of people ask. Look, if Stacks has smart contracts for Bitcoin, it's a programming layer, then why can't you just have Bitcoin directly in the programming layer? And the short answer to that is we would love to, but it's a very hard technical challenge that not just us, but a lot of other people have been working on for years and years and years. There isn’t any solution for that today.</p><p>So what else can people do? Recently we've seen two types of solutions. One solution is a custodian way of issuing a wrapped asset, which is what xBTC is, right? So the folks at Tokensoft, or Wrapped, which is basically their arm for doing this, have worked with reputable professional custodians to do this. And I think that model works.</p><p>The other model is you can put up some collateral. On the spectrum of things, you could argue that this is more decentralized, but I think that has drawbacks as well, right? Because when you're going through a custodian, you don't have to put up that much collateral. You can deposit one BTC, and you can mint one xBTC. Whereas, in the other model, sometimes you get into over collateralization issues.</p><p>I'm in the camp that all of these solutions make different trade offs, and there's a place for all of these solutions. In the end, what a normal user is looking for is they want to avoid the price risk of exiting Bitcoin. Right? That's what I care about. I don't want to exit BTC and enter some other asset. And that is a property you absolutely get with xBTC.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm so glad to see this solution live because it opens up so many possibilities. And when other types of Bitcoin-derived assets become available, that will just give users even more options.</p><h5>Kyle:</h5><p>What are some additional opportunities you see from xBTC that could bring in the next wave of applications?</p><h5>Muneeb:</h5><p>From my side, the mission for Stacks is really enabling Web 3 in Bitcoin. For example, let's say you're building an NFT marketplace and now you want to enable trading in BTC. Well, the next best thing is to just enable trading in xBTC, right? They’re the same price, and people can do trustless swaps between the two assets. So in that particular example, now you have a NFT marketplace where you can inject Bitcoin liquidity, which potentially could be a pretty large market, right?</p><p>When xBTC is in Stacks, it's completely programmable. You could basically write any computer program in Clarity language, and you can do so many things. That's the main difference between BTC on the main chain and xBTC on Stacks.</p><h5>Kyle:</h5><p>Patrick, I want to come to you around maybe your thoughts on how xBTC and some of those examples that Muneeb just provided could impact the future of something like City Coins, for instance.</p><h5>Patrick:</h5><p>The most basic thing that I believe xBTC should enable is just new price pairs on exchanges, creating more liquidity for people to have capital flight at the speed of light. If you are not liking what New York City is doing and you want to move to Miami, you might move there with your coins first. You might sell New York City and enter Miami. And I think xBTC helps make that easier on things like DEXs.</p><h5>Kyle:</h5><p>Mason, Will, Brittany, any additional thoughts from you three on how Wrapped BTC really opens up new opportunities for developers and future applications.</p><h5>Will Binns:</h5><p>For a long time, the killer app with Bitcoin has been holding Bitcoin. And as we look to really harvest the potential of what's possible with Bitcoin, opening it up to DeFi is the key piece. We've seen just how fast dApps have grown on the Ethereum network, but even still, you look at the top of CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, and it’s Bitcoin. Stacks is the closest thing to us being able to unlock DeFi for Bitcoin.</p><p>So that's what's really exciting about xBTC. It's backed one to one with Bitcoin. So 21 million Bitcoins, 21 million xBTC. That's all there’ll ever be. And as we look to try to take this beyond, in say Arkadiko and ALEX, I think it's really exciting to look at how they can do new financial products that are denominated in Bitcoin. We all watch the news and whatnot and see all this craziness with inflation, so I think that there's a very interesting possibility of a different future here.</p><h5>Mason:</h5><p>If you go back to the history of Bitcoin, in 2013, 2014, there was still a lot of innovation at the protocol layer, and then each of these innovations became their own new use case. And sometimes people would go on to build new applications on top of that new use case. The thing is the innovation tapered off at some point. And if you look at Bitcoin today, the main use case is still just payments.</p><p>What excites me the most about Stacks and xBTC is it's like opening Pandora's box. With an asset denominated Bitcoin, you can actually do anything. You can create AMMs, NFTs denominated in Bitcoin. You can take loans out on your Bitcoin. There was no decentralized way to take out loans on your Bitcoin until these solutions start to exist. And so I think that's what I'm really excited about is just the number of use cases that we're going to see that are now denominated in Bitcoin.</p><h5>Kyle:</h5><p>Brittany, any additional thoughts? I mean, Mason, he calls it out. We've got probably eight, nine new ideas of potential use cases just thrown around here. What opportunities are you seeing with this new rapid BTC coming to Stacks and opening up the world of applications and use cases?</p><h5><strong>Brittany</strong>:</h5><p>I think we've seen there's a lot of folks who love Bitcoin and they just don't know what they can do with it. When they hear about, “oh, well, if you had Bitcoin, and you could use it in different applications, like DeFi and NFTs”, it clicks for them, and they say, \"Oh, yeah, that would be really cool.\"</p><p>I think xBTC just makes it even easier to innovate, especially with all the integrations that already exist with Stacks. For builders listening who are like, \"Okay, maybe I want to try something really cool with xBTC. I don't know exactly what it is yet,\" I think this is a great place to experiment with building a small prototype. I've seen in our community that sometimes if you just put an idea out, you can very quickly get a lot of feedback from smart people.</p><p>We've seen this with atomic swaps. Someone wrote up a little bit of code. They put the idea out there, and then now there are teams building on it. So if you're thinking about how to experiment with this, start small, get some feedback on the idea and then see if you can ship something. And for us at the Stacks Foundation, we're just constantly looking for ways to point resources back at people who are trying to experiment with these things.</p><p>I think over the next three months, we're going to see a lot of experiments and then probably in six months, this will just be as common as we think about anything else. We'll be like, \"Oh, yeah, of course xBTC is really useful in these certain cases.\"<br></p><p>Listen to the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nohbPveFf9I\">full conversation on YouTube</a>, and learn more about the speakers at:<br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.tokensoft.io/\">tokensoft.io</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.alexgo.io/\">alexgo.io</a></li><li><a href=\"https://stacks.org/\">stacks.org</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.citycoins.co/\">citycoins.co</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trustmachines.co/\">trustmachines.co</a>‍<br></li></ul>",

      "post-body":
        '<p>More than 2,500 Clarity smart contracts have been <a href="https://clarity-deployed-contracts.netlify.app/">deployed</a> on the Stacks blockchain, and developers have created more than 200 Clarity repos on GitHub. Today, we add another important milestone to the list: <a href="https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/5665">Clarity is now recognized</a> as an official programming language on GitHub.<br></p><p>This recognition is an important milestone for Clarity and the Stacks ecosystem. It legitimizes all of the work that we as a community have done <a href="https://from0to.hiro.so/">in the first year</a> since Stacks’ mainnet launch, and it’s a strong signal of our growth to the broader developer community.<br></p><p>So what does this recognition mean for developers? In the coming weeks and months (as Clarity’s newly updated status is reflected on GitHub), developers will benefit from some new features that will make their lives easier, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Advanced search: </strong>You will be able to use the advanced search function in GitHub to search for Clarity files directly. Previously, developers had to search for the string <em>.clar</em>, which would return a lot of files that weren’t relevant to Clarity. This change will make it easier for developers to look through GitHub repos written in Clarity and find active smart contracts.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Syntax highlighting: </strong>You will be able to add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting. This can help make your code’s meaning and structure more clear for yourself, for your team, and the general public.</li><li><strong>Language breakdown: </strong>You will be able to see a language breakdown in the sidebar of a specific repo, showing how much of the code is written in Clarity compared to other languages in the repo. The repository stats API can also be used on a directory to obtain a Language Graph by aggregating the languages of all repo\'s blobs.<br></li></ul><p>To celebrate this announcement, we are donating $2,022 to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF), one of the leading nonprofit organizations defending civil liberties in the digital world. Since 1990, they have supported critical issues surrounding technology such as free speech, privacy, innovation, transparency, international regulation, and security. EFF shares the mission of Hiro, Stacks, and the entire Bitcoin community: building a free and open internet that anyone can access and participate in.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Stacks blockchain was designed to establish a network for decentralized applications that leveraged Bitcoin’s security, decentralization, and latent capital. Through Clarity smart contracts, developers can build apps where the user isn’t the end product. Hiro provides vital developer tools and services to those developers, so that Stackers can build the next generation of the internet.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s use this milestone to kick start our year and 10X our growth in 2022. It won’t happen overnight, but we have always asserted:<em> the internet isn’t going to decentralize itself</em>. We hope GitHub’s recognition and this donation can help us all get one step closer to the dream of a user-controlled internet.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Ready to learn Clarity?

      name: "The Reign of Centralized Apps Is Ending: Start Building dApps to Replace Them Today",
      "post-body":
        '<p>Despite the growing excitement around them, decentralized apps (dApps) are underdogs right now in terms of adoption. As of October 2021, dApps had <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1280597/global-total-users-virtual-platforms/">about 226 million total users</a>. Compare that to traditional apps, where social media networks alone had <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/">3.78 billion total users</a> in 2021. Yet, developers who take on the challenge of building dApps may be rewarded because not only are many consumers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/trust-big-tech-facebook">wary of Big Tech</a>, but decentralized apps provide entirely new incentives for user adoption.</p><h2><strong>Decentralized Apps vs. Centralized Apps</strong></h2><p>The main differences between a decentralized app and a centralized one relate to ownership, data storage, and how users interact with one another.</p><p><strong>Decentralized apps</strong> are open source. The codebase is distributed across the nodes of the blockchain, users interact directly with one another, and interactions between users are managed by smart contracts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Centralized apps</strong> are owned by corporations. The codebase is stored on servers owned or controlled by a company, users don’t interact with each other directly, and interactions between users are managed and controlled by the company’s server, all behind closed doors.</p><h3>Examples of decentralized apps vs. centralized apps</h3><p>Even when both a dApp and a centralized app serve the same function, the dApp will be inherently more user-oriented, democratic, and permissionless. And that battle over permissionless vs permissioned apps, a battle between decentralization and centralization, is already happening in a number of different industries and types of applications.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.stackswap.org/home">Stackswap</a> vs. <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a> (Financial services)</li><li><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> vs. <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> (Browsers)</li><li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> vs. <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> (Social networks)</li><li><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a> vs. <a href="https://www.zynga.com/games/farmville-2/">FarmVille2</a> (Gaming)<br></li></ul><h2><strong>What dApps Do Better Than Centralized Apps</strong></h2><p>While on the surface, the user experience between a dApp and a centralized app can be similar, they are quite different structurally and technologically. Here’s how those differences can benefit consumers, giving dApps an edge over centralized incumbents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Create composability</h3><p>Decentralized applications create composability because their code is open-source. This means that anyone can see the code and contribute towards improving the dApp. Developers can also combine code from different dApps to create entirely new dApps much faster than it takes to start a new dApp from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, in 2020, developer(s) known as Chef Nomi <a href="https://medium.com/@blockchain_simplified/sushiswap-the-appetizing-fork-of-uniswap-7dd0ed67aa8e">forked Uniswap’s code</a> to create a competing decentralized exchange (DEX) called SushiSwap. SushiSwap added many community-oriented features such as staking, liquidity rewards, and governance tokens to Uniswap’s original idea. The community-oriented features on SushiSwap saw it getting <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-defi-craze-continues-with-sushiswap-250-million-locked-in-an-unaudited-contract-again/">more than $250 million locked</a> within the first 24 hours — but above all, it showed how dApps benefit from crowdsourced innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that developers can easily access open-source code to improve existing dApps or create new ones leads to more composability, deeper collaboration, and faster innovation; all of which will fuel dApps to overtake traditional apps.&nbsp;</p><h3>Enable a share of economic returns to all users</h3><p>One of the unique features that give dApps an edge over centralized apps is how their economic models are designed to distribute economic rewards to all participants rather than a few owners of the app, such as the founders and early investors. In a decentralized app, users can buy, earn, and own the network tokens that the dApp runs on, and those tokens theoretically reflect the value of the dApp itself.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>In other words, dApps can give users a vested interest in the application because their usage can make them an actual owner of the app!</blockquote><p>Imagine if Uber gave Uber shares to drivers every time they completed a ride. It’s not a perfect analogy, but it illustrates the concept of ownership being distributed to users, according to their usage. It’s a powerful idea, and many dApps have this as a core mechanism. For example, Brave browser <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/what-is-basic-attention-token-and-how-to-earn-bat">rewards users</a> with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) every time they watch an ad (effectively giving users some of the ad revenue) while using the web browser.</p><p>In contrast, users of centralized apps don’t get to participate in the value accrued by the network. That value only goes back to the app’s stakeholders. This gives dApps a superpower over centralized apps because they can give users skin in the game, which creates brand loyalty and sticky users who are incentivized to stay, to use the dApp more, and to spread the word. It unlocks the possibility to have a significantly stronger community.</p><h3>Provide open access</h3><p>Anybody from any part of the world could access and use dApps without prejudice (as long as they have an internet connection) because dApps are permissionless. There are no geofencing restrictions and fewer regulatory obstacles. Democratized access leads to a more equitable distribution of wealth, accelerates financial inclusion, and breaks down prejudices.</p><p>Centralized applications often make decisions about who can or can’t access or use their apps. For instance, PayPal <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/paypal-not-in-africa">excluded</a> much of Africa from participating in its global economy for more than a decade, and now, it only maintains <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ga/webapps/mpp/ua/residence-full#:~:text=Countries/regions%20with%20the%20ability%20to%20send%20payments,do%20not%20have%20the%20ability%20to%20receive%20payments.">a one-sided relationship</a> that allows people living in many African countries to send but not receive funds.</p><p>Compare that to anecdotes from dApps: Afghans can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/09/crypto-remittances-are-a-lifeline-for-the-worlds-most-vulnerable/">receive remittances</a> after Western Union abruptly suspended services in the country, Nigerian creators can <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/23/africa/nigeria-artist-nft-cryptocurrency-lgs-spc-intl/index.html">sell their art</a> on the international scene without going through gatekeepers, and millions of Filipino people <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo-BrASMHU4">can earn income</a> from a play-to-earn game. When the entire world can use your dApp, the growth ceiling is much higher than if you are only targeting US consumers.</p><h3>Enable data portability</h3><p>Data portability refers to the ability of users to <a href="https://www.striim.com/etl-vs-elt-2/">access, extract, and move</a> their data from one service to another in a structured, tagged, and machine-parsable manner. Decentralized apps enable data portability because users own their data, and ownership gives them the freedom to choose what apps to use.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, if you use Spotify, the app will eventually understand your music preferences enough to suggest playlists you’ll like and suppress genres you can’t stand. However, if you switch to Apple Music, you’ll have to teach the new service your music preferences all over again. With dApps, users <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1479920741768261633">retain ownership and control</a> of their data, and you don’t have to worry about starting from scratch whenever you switch apps that provide similar services.</p><p>Also, because users own their data, they can choose how that data is used or shared. While centralized apps often claim that you own your data, their terms of services include licensing clauses that give them liberal access to use your data as they see fit. For instance, both <a href="https://web.facebook.com/legal/terms">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/en/tos">Twitter</a>, and many other social network sites have licensing clauses like:</p><p>“<em>By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods now known or later….”&nbsp;</em></p><p>And their access to your data doesn’t stop even when you delete your posts or your account.</p><h3>Facilitate community input and governance</h3><p>Another feature that could help dApps displace centralized applications is their inherently democratic governance. Beyond simply using a dApp, the community is often required to participate in the decision-making process by debating and voting on new features, updates, and upgrades before they are implemented.</p><p>The depth of community participation enables the dApps to evolve in the best interests of the majority of users, unlike centralized apps where a handful of people in a corporation make decisions for all users. Sometimes, the people in charge make good decisions. Other times, they make bad ones, such as when Google made a unilateral decision to <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/stay-top-finance-information-google/">kill off Google Finance</a>, citing a need to integrate updates about the financial markets into Google Search. Users had no say in the decision, and many amateur investors and financial services professionals who have spent years curating screeners, portfolios, and watchlists <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/google-finance-backlash/">lost all their market data</a>.</p><p>With dApps, users have a voice, and they can propose changes or vote against decisions that they do not like. More so, users that disagree with any decisions can choose to fork the dApp to create a version of the dApp that is not subject to those decisions. The governance also extends to peer-to-peer interactions as the community of users employs democratic principles to punish/remove bad actors without any user wielding too much power that could be abused.</p><h3>Enhance user privacy and data security</h3><p>dApps provide users with enhanced privacy because users do not need to create unique accounts with personal information for every app they use. Often the only requirement for using a dApp is for the user to connect their crypto wallet.&nbsp; Users can choose to have multiple wallets for multiple dApps (or just use one across all dApps), and they can choose to what extent any wallet or dApp account is to be associated/connected with their person.</p><p>On the other hand, centralized apps require users to create accounts with verified credentials, which are often stored in a database. Sometimes that database gets compromised. For example, in 2021, personal information for more than <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/30/linkedin-data-theft-700-million-users-personal-information-cybersecurity/">700 million LinkedIn users</a> was compromised and put on sale for a paltry sum of $5,000. The data leak contained a wealth of information, including full names, phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, gender, and other social media usernames. Those types of data breaches are not infrequent, but since dApps don’t require users to provide personal data on sign-up, there is no database of personal information to be compromised in the first place.</p><p>The data that dApps do collect and keep, such as transactions and transactional metadata, are stored securely on the blockchain and are pseudonymous. And while blockchains can also be hacked and their data overwritten, it becomes theoretically impossible to do so for established blockchains because of the computing and financial requirements to do so.</p><p>For example, you’ll need to<a href="https://learn.eqonex.com/news/what-51-attack-and-how-much-would-it-cost"> spend at least $13.5B</a> on mining equipment (if you could find it) and electric power to double Bitcoin’s existing hash rate to have a theoretically-viable shot at a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network. But the game theory dynamics of the Bitcoin ecosystem will make the attempt impractical. It’s more beneficial for the hacker to be an honest participant in the network than it is to follow through on the attack.</p><h3>Resist censorship&nbsp;</h3><p>Traditional centralized apps are at the mercy of big tech, and big tech itself is at the mercy of governments and its agencies. Centralized apps must meet certain requirements to be accessible to users; otherwise, they risk being suspended, permabanned, or de-platformed (e.g. Apple removing the app from the App Store or GoDaddy shutting down their web hosting). Centralized apps can also censor users since there’s an administration with the power to remove/delete users’ content or accounts, such as frequently happens with centralized social networks that <a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/06/02/nine-times-twitter-banned-suspended-or-censored-prominent-figures-countries-over-posts">ban, delete, or remove users’ content</a>.</p><p>dApps have censorship resistance features in that it is practically impossible to remove them from a blockchain network. Blockchains are immutable, and data stored on the blockchain can’t be deleted. Government or its agents can’t shut down blockchain networks once they are fully propagated. So, dApps hosted on a blockchain can continue to function for as long as the underlying blockchain exists.</p><p>Similarly, dApps can’t enforce censorship on users because the users’ activity is stored on the blockchain with read-only access rather than in a centralized database. dApps promote transparency because all blockchain activity is visible on explorers, and users can review what actions the developers and other stakeholders take on the dApp. Where edits are possible, they will be stored as new records, but the older records will still be available to interested parties.</p><p>Because decentralized apps are censorship-resistant, issues such as Facebook moderation bots mistakenly deactivating accounts <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/facebook-deactivates-accounts-dozens-palestinian-journalists-and-activists">belonging to Palestinian journalists and activists</a> or YouTube machine-learning algorithms erroneously <a href="https://blog.witness.org/2017/08/vital-human-rights-evidence-syria-disappearing-youtube/">disappearing documentation</a> of war crimes in Syria won’t be possible. <br></p><h2><strong>With Bitcoin, dApps Can Enjoy Faster User Adoption&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The crypto industry has created $3 trillion of liquid value in 10 years, comparable to the valuation of all <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/crunchbase-unicorn-board-1000-companies/">private venture-backed unicorns combined</a>, and that value creation is led by Bitcoin. There is an incredibly large but still untapped opportunity to bring dApps to the Bitcoin ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tap into an existing community</h3><p>Bitcoin has a large and dedicated community of users. More than 60% of Bitcoiners have been<a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/why-building-for-bitcoin-is-the-future"> holding BTC for more than a year.</a>&nbsp; Whether they are <a href="https://twitter.com/muneeb/status/1479141447110639618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Bitcoin centrists or Bitcoin maximalists</a>, one thing that Bitcoiners all have in common is a passionate and vocal belief that Bitcoin is a powerful force for positive disruption. When you build for Bitcoin, you’ll have an army of advocates ready to adopt your app.</p><h3>Access patient latent capital</h3><p>Developers who build dApps on the Bitcoin network can create opportunities for Bitcoin hodlers to put their assets to work. Currently, Bitcoin mostly functions as a store of value. Bitcoin has a market cap of nearly $1 trillion, but only about <a href="https://defipulse.com/btc">$14.2 billion worth of Bitcoin</a> is deployed in Bitcoin Defi. The rest of that capital is waiting to be unlocked by new Bitcoin dApps.</p><h3>Accelerate through flywheel effects</h3><p>There’s already a large community of Bitcoin users, but the flywheel effect could cause the community to grow exponentially faster. New dApps encourage more users to participate in the network. More participation leads to an increase in the value of Bitcoin. Increased value attracts more developers to build new apps, which attracts new users, and the cycle goes on. Through this flywheel, Bitcoin dApp growth could accelerate, further establishing Bitcoin’s market dominance.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>Stacks Enables You to Build dApps for Bitcoin</strong></h2><p>For developers who want to build dApps that can compete with centralized apps and win, you’ll need the Bitcoin advantage to supercharge the ability of your dApps to displace traditional apps.</p><p><a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks blockchain</a> is the programming layer of the Bitcoin network, and it enables you to write fully expressive smart contracts to create dApps secured by Bitcoin.&nbsp;Want to learn how to build dApps for Bitcoin?&nbsp;We have a <a href="https://docs.hiro.so/">comprehensive library of developer resources and tools</a> to get you started.<br></p>',

        '<p>Web3 is an open-source, internet in which users have ownership of their data and permissionless access to applications without going through intermediaries. Instead of those centralized intermediaries, blockchain-powered decentralized programs drive peer-to-peer economic networks for exchanging value and information. Web3 hopes to reduce the influence and power of centralized monopolies and make the internet a more democratic place.</p><h2><strong>The Internet (R)evolution: From Web1 to Web3</strong></h2><p>To understand Web3 and what it means for the future of the internet, let’s take a step back in time to understand how the internet has evolved.</p><ul><li><strong>Web1 (~1989 - 2004): read</strong> — The internet functioned as a portal of static web pages that presented information to the public in “read-only” formats. Web1 users could consume content but couldn’t interact with it, or with each other.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Web2 (~2005 - 2020): read-write</strong> — Web users evolved from being “readers” to “creators”, and websites evolved from being “read-only” static information portals to “read-write” platforms through which users could consume, create, and interact with information, and with each other.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Web3 (~2021 - present): read-write-own</strong> — The internet is transforming from “read-write” platforms to “read-write-own” networks. Now “users” and “creators” are also “owners”, of their own data but also often of the very platforms and apps they use. Web3 enables networks to align incentives with their users, so both participate in the rewards of growth and market adoption.</li></ul><p>As a developer, building Web3 apps for this new paradigm may seem daunting because the underlying blockchain technology is new and complex, but in fact, if you already know how to build Web2 apps, you already have the foundational knowledge you need. For developers interested in building the next generation of web applications, this post provides a comprehensive introduction to the Web3 tech stack.</p><h2><strong>What Is the Tech Stack for Web3 Apps?</strong></h2><p>A tech stack refers to all of the technology and services used to build an application. A stack generally includes components like development frameworks, programming languages, and technical infrastructure. The six main components of the tech stack for Web3 applications are:</p><ul><li>Blockchain</li><li>Smart contracts</li><li>Development environment</li><li>Testing frameworks</li><li>User identity management</li><li>UI/UX components</li></ul><h2><strong>Blockchain: The Foundation for Web3 Apps</strong></h2><p>The blockchain is the foundation for Web3 applications, and there are many different options for developers to choose from. Those options have different tradeoffs, ranging from different programming languages, varying levels of security, contrasting approaches to consensus, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In Web2, the equivalent of the blockchain layer would be the operating system, with the most dominant being iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, and WebOS. The operating system often influences both the design and implementation decisions that developers make when designing Web2 applications, and the same is true with how the blockchain layer influences the applications built on top of it.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, the blockchain that serves as the foundation of a web3 app has important ramifications for the adoption and success of the project. Here are some of the options developers can choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/why-building-for-bitcoin-is-the-future">most dominant blockchain</a> in terms of adoption and market capitalization, and it is gradually evolving to enable Web3 apps. Developers who want to build Web3 apps for Bitcoin can build them through the <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> blockchain, which functions as a programmable layer for Bitcoin. Through Stacks, developers can build applications that tap into nearly $1T of latent capital locked in the Bitcoin ecosystem, as well as build on the most secure and decentralized blockchain released to date.</li><li><strong>Ethereum</strong> is <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/dapps-ethereum-decentralized-application">the first smart contract platform</a>, and as a result, a large number of decentralized applications run on Ethereum today. Ethereum has the <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">largest developer community</a> out of any blockchain and an even larger community of users. As a result of its popularity, many alternative blockchains to Ethereum are still compatible with Ethereum and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, such as Solana, Avalanche, and Fantom, which makes it easier to bridge applications between those blockchains.</li></ul><p>Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are other blockchain platforms on which developers can build Web3 applications. However, for the sake of brevity, we will limit our exploration of the Web3 stack in this article to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest blockchains.</p><h2><strong>Smart Contracts: The Code for Web3 Apps</strong></h2><p>After the blockchain, the next most important component in the tech stack are smart contracts. A smart contract refers to a program stored on a blockchain that is designed to be self-executing when predetermined conditions are met. What makes them “smart” is that self-execution: these programs do not have administrators or controllers — they are fully autonomous code</p><p>Since Web2 applications are centralized, there is no need for the autonomous, self-executing functionality of smart contracts. Therefore, the closest “equivalent” to the smart contract layer would be the actual code of the applications themselves. There are many different programming languages for writing software code. Developers choose programming languages based on the type of application they intend to build, their technical sophistication, and personal preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>The same is true for smart contract programming languages for web3. However, it’s worth noting that the choice of programming language is often dependent on the blockchain layer chosen.</p><h3>Smart Contract Development in the Bitcoin Ecosystem</h3><p>The Bitcoin ecosystem didn’t originally start out with smart contracts because Bitcoin had a <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-holds-the-secret-to-solving-the-trilemma-for-blockchain-platforms">limited scripting language by design</a>. The arrival of the Stacks blockchain provided Bitcoin with a smart contract layer, and now, developers can create and use smart contracts for Bitcoin to build apps on the most secure blockchain.&nbsp;</p><h4>Clarity Programming Language</h4><p>To write smart contracts for Bitcoin, developers use the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/smart-contracts-cant-afford-to-fail-and-with-clarity-language-they-wont">Clarity language</a>, an open-source programming language that is optimized for security and predictability. Clarity is heavily influenced by LISP and benefits from the time-tested strengths of other LISP-like languages, such as brevity, being easier to reason about, and better composability.</p><h4>Overview of Bitcoin’s Smart Contract Traction</h4><p>Since the launch of the Stacks blockchain, Clarity has grown in popularity for the development of smart contracts and dApps. More than 2,500 smart contracts have already been written in Clarity and deployed on the blockchain. Some live Web3 applications written with Clarity include <a href="https://arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a>, <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/">CityCoins</a>, <a href="https://stxnft.com/">STXNFT</a>, and dozens more.</p><h3>Smart Contract Development on Ethereum</h3><p>Ethereum popularized the idea of smart contracts by providing the first programming language to write them and a blockchain network on which they can be deployed. Ethereum is currently <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/dapps-ethereum-decentralized-application">the most dominant smart</a> contract platform, but its first-mover advantage is declining as it grapples with <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">high transaction costs</a> and<a href="https://tokenist.com/explained-ethereums-scalability-problems-and-growing-backlash/"> scalability challenges</a>.</p><h4>Solidity Programming Language</h4><p><a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/">Solidity</a> is Ethereum’s programming language for writing smart contracts. Solidity is an object-oriented programming language with a syntax inspired by C++. The influence of C++ on Solidity’s syntax is apparent in concepts such as for loops, overloading functions, and variable declarations, among others. Solidity is specified for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and code written in Solidity must be compiled to EVM’s bytecode before they can run. This means that the language is not human-readable once deployed on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><h4>Overview of Ethereum’s Smart Contract Traction</h4><p>Ethereum currently leads other blockchains in the development of smart contracts (it has had a several-year head start after all). <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">Electric Capital’s 2021 Developer Report</a> observes that between 20% and 25% of new Web3 developers start out on the Ethereum blockchain. Some of the most popular Web3 applications, such as <a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>, and <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound Finance</a>, launched on Ethereum.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Development Environment for Web3 Apps</strong></h2><p>The development environments in Web3 are not that different from what you may be used to in Web2, and most integrated development environments (IDEs), have built plugins to enable developers to write smart contract code even more easily.</p><h3>Bitcoin Web3 Development Environment</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet">Clarinet</a> is the development environment for writing smart contracts and building Web3 applications on the Stacks blockchain for the Bitcoin ecosystem. It is designed to ease you into the world of smart contracts without much friction. Clarinet is a local Clarity language runtime packaged as a command-line application for smart contract development, testing, and deployment. Once installed, you can use Clarinet to create a new project, add new contracts to your project, check the syntax of your contracts, measure cost coverage, and make cost optimizations, among many other features.</p><p>The <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HiroSystems.clarity-lsp">Clarity for Visual Studio Code plugin</a> provides a familiar IDE experience for writing smart contract code in VS Code. The plugin provides syntax assistance and debugging features for Clarity smart contracts. Clarity VS Code natively supports auto-complete functionality and enables you to check your contracts and display errors inline.</p><h3>Ethereum Web3 Development Environment</h3><p>Setting up a development environment on Ethereum might seem daunting simply because there are many different options. Ethereum’s development environments include:</p><p><a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix</a> is an open-source tool for creating smart contracts and building Web3 applications with Solidity. Remix functions both as a compiler and IDE, and it is available as a browser and a desktop application that you can run locally. Remix also provides educational modules for learning the Solidity programming language.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle">Truffle</a> is a development environment for writing smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains with EVM compatibility. Truffle is outfitted with smart contract compilation, code linking, binary management, and contract deployment.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/embarklabs/embark#readme">Embark</a> is a framework that you can use to develop and deploy dApps on Ethereum, EVM chains, and decentralized storage networks such as IPFS and Swarm.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Testing Environment for Web3 Apps</strong></h2><p>Web3 applications don’t exist in isolation; they have logic that interacts with the network, including the blockchain’s global state, decentralized storage systems (more on that in a bit), and other types of data. So, when you create a Web3 app, you not only need to test it in a local environment but also test in one that simulates real-life data sources from the blockchain, a testnet. A testnet refers to an instance of a blockchain that allows a Web3 app to interact with live blockchain data but without the finality and immutability of live blockchain transactions.</p><p>The Web2 equivalent of a testnet would be the pre-deployment testing in a staging environment when apps are tested for compatibility, performance, stress, security, and usability. Pre-deployment testing is typically done via <a href="https://www.katalon.com/resources-center/blog/continuous-testing-tools/">testing solutions</a> such as Google App Engine or Selenium.</p><h3>Stacks Testnet for Bitcoin</h3><p>The <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/testnet">Stacks testnet</a> is a staging environment for testing Web3 applications built for the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Stacks testnet produces blocks at almost the same pace as the mainnet, and it maintains a network history similar to that of the Stacks mainnet. The Stacks testnet also includes a testnet faucet that provides test Stacks (STX) tokens to enable transactions on the testnet. The users on the testnet can use the faucet tokens to try all the app’s features without risking tokens with real-world value.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ethereum Testnets</h3><p>Ethereum offers multiple testnets to developers, and <a href="https://www.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby</a> is one of the most popular options. It has a block time of about 15 seconds, similar to the block time on the Ethereum mainnet, and developers can get Rinkeby Faucet tokens to get ‘fake’ ether to test out gas prices, transactions times, and other parameters on their apps without having to spend real money during the test process. Other Ethereum testnets include <a href="https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/">Kovan </a>and <a href="https://ropsten.etherscan.io/">Ropsten</a>.<br></p><h2><strong>File Storage Solutions for Web3 Applications</strong></h2><p>Apps generate data, and that data needs to be stored somewhere. Developers of both Web2 and Web3 applications need file storage, and different storage options can have different prioritizations of scalability, availability, and usability.&nbsp;</p><p>Web3 apps on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks can use the same decentralized file storage options to securely store their data. With decentralized storage, you can significantly reduce downtime risks and ensure consistent availability because millions of computers serve as nodes to deliver content as needed. Decentralized file storage solutions make your Web3 apps more resistant to censorship because it is difficult to shut down decentralized and distributed servers. Decentralized file storage includes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is a distributed file system designed to help store and access data across a peer-to-peer network. IPFS empowers developers to store, timestamp, and secure large files without having to put the data itself on-chain.</li><li><a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> takes the idea of decentralized file storage further by ensuring the permanence of data. Arweave is building a permaweb, managed by a global community of users and developers who are incentivized to maintain the data storage layer.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/stacks-network/gaia">Gaia</a> is a decentralized storage platform available to developers building apps on the Stacks blockchain. The transactional metadata of the apps is stored on the blockchain itself, while user application data is stored in Gaia to ensure that users enjoy high performance and availability.</li></ul><p>Developers can also use centralized storage solutions like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure (commonly used in Web2 apps) to manage their storage needs. If you choose a centralized storage solution, you can generally expect cheaper costs relative to on-site self-storage and decentralized options. You also get a solution that is optimized for performance. Centralized storage comes with product features like automated server-load balancing and extensive customizations to optimize app performance.</p><h2><strong>Identity Management in Web3 Applications</strong></h2><p>In order to fully realize the read-write-own promise of Web3, developers need a new way of managing digital identity for their users. Fundamentally, identity management revolves around user authentication and authorization to ensure that the right users have the correct privileges within the app and can access their account. Digital identity is critically important for the security and reliability of any application.</p><p>In Web1 applications, users needed to provide a unique login and password to identify themselves and access each application they used. Users were encouraged to have different passwords for every website for security. Good luck remembering 50 different passwords!</p><p>In Web2 applications, big tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, addressed that pain point and extended the portability of users’ identities to other apps. In many Web2 apps, users can leverage their Google or Facebook identities as credentials to sign in to other applications, but that ease comes with risk. If your Google account was hacked, for example, that could mean multiple accounts were compromised.</p><p>In Web3 applications, user identity is managed by wallets. A wallet is a unique address on a blockchain that provides a user with an identity and a place to store their digital assets. Wallets serve as a means of establishing users’ identities using public-private key cryptography. Public keys are used to encrypt data, and private keys are used to decrypt them. The possession of the correct combination of the public and private keys establish the identity of the user.</p><p>Wallets also serve as the primary medium of interaction. They enable users to:</p><ul><li>Buy, hold, and sell digital assets</li><li>Send and receive digital assets from other accounts</li><li>Connect to apps</li></ul><p>In the Bitcoin ecosystem, users have many wallets they can choose from, including the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet">Hiro Wallet</a>, <a href="https://boom.money">Boom Wallet</a>, and <a href="https://www.xverse.app">Xverse Wallet</a>. In the Ethereum ecosystem, users can choose from <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>, <a href="https://rainbow.me">Rainbow</a>, and <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com">MyEtherWallet</a>, among others. In both ecosystems, these wallets are available as a combination of browser extensions, mobile applications or desktop applications.</p><h2><strong>The UI/UX for Web3 Apps</strong></h2><p>The user interface and experience design define how users interact with applications. In Web3, that user interface is fairly similar to Web2. Developers will often use HTML to structure the app and&nbsp; CSS for styling, regardless of whether the app is built on Bitcoin, Ethereum, or a different blockchain altogether.</p><p>Just as in Web2, a user’s email or phone number is used for identity management, in Web3, the user’s wallet address is used for identification and authorization.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img alt="image" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6204152480ae5594dd7ca0a1_N7zyaxCO-VE9mXkGibcn0yPzlHt549fagfHN8aiG9Zcsj6VfHWue3qNwnN5K5sbSFkDCrmoSGxb7P5OvhNDYSAvRtwk_XmVSC_Pr6UsTI0Kb_a0EicEUPgxvqrmThi4ey7GPFZWa.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Most blockchains have Javascript libraries with general purpose commands for building applications and managing the user experience.</p><p>For Bitcoin, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks.js">Stacks.js</a> library to access a wealth of resources for managing&nbsp; identity, authentication, storage, transactions, and more on the Stacks blockchain.</p><p>On the Ethereum network, <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.0/">Web3.js</a> or <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/">Ether.js</a>, are general-purpose libraries that you can use to manage the user experience of your Web3 app for access to local or remote Ethereum nodes.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Start Building the Decentralized Future Today</strong></h2><p>In a vacuum it’s difficult for individual developers or entrepreneurs to build Web3 applications that can viably compete with existing Web2 incumbents — think about the technical, economic, and social resources that would be needed to build a Facebook competitor from scratch.</p><p>However, the permissionless nature of Web3 means that there are lower barriers to entry, and independent developers can easily collaborate to build Web3 applications that create entirely new paradigms. By contributing to existing or building new Web3 applications, you can advance the evolution of the internet toward open, transparent, and democratic ownership.</p><p>The tech stack for Web3 applications has familiar origins in the tech stack for Web2 apps, and if you already know how to build Web2 applications, you can easily become a Web3 developer.</p><p><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/"><strong>Get started today!</strong></a><br></p>',

      "post-body":
        '<p><a href="https://www.avg.com/en/signal/is-bitcoin-safe">Bitcoin</a> is the most secure, reliable, and fully decentralized blockchain that exists today, and the market reinforces that point. Bitcoin’s market cap is double that of the incumbent NFT platform, Ethereum. In fact, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Bitcoin’s market capitalization</a> is over $700B at the time of this publication (and has crossed $1T in the past). The overall market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is around $1.6 trillion, and Ethereum is the second-most valued digital currency, with a market capitalization of over $300 billion.<br></p><p>The notion of a Bitcoin-backed NFT is not a novel one. Developers are bringing NFTs to many different blockchains. However, Bitcoin NFTs are a concept that many developers are just now discovering is possible thanks to the <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks blockchain</a>, which is a programmable layer for Bitcoin.</p><h2><strong>What Is a Bitcoin NFT?&nbsp;</strong><br></h2><p>A Bitcoin NFT is a non-fungible token secured by Bitcoin and built using the Stacks blockchain. We’ll get into the mechanics of how a Bitcoin NFT works below, but first let’s explore what an NFT is. A non-fungible token is unique, whereas a fungible token is interchangeable (for example, trade a $10 bill for a different $10 bill, and there is no material difference between them).<br></p><p>That non-fungible trait is critical to a problem we face today: digital content is considerably easier to duplicate than something that is physical. To the human eye, there’s little-to-no difference between a copy and the original when dealing with digital mediums. That makes it really hard for digital assets to become valuable if they can be duplicated an infinite number of times.<br></p><p>NFTs solve that problem. NFTs create and retain value for digital content through their uniqueness by creating and enforcing actual digital scarcity. In other words, NFTs effectively enable digital property rights because the technology allows users to prove that they own a specific digital asset. That enables digital goods to capitalize on the laws of supply and demand and have standalone value for the first time in history.<br></p><p>So what sets Bitcoin NFTs apart from other NFTs? Simply put, Bitcoin NFTs are created for the Bitcoin network instead of another blockchain, such as Ethereum. And which blockchain an NFT is on has important ramifications for the security of that asset.<br></p><p>Bitcoin is the most decentralized and secure blockchain. It offers exceptional durability and stability for assets created and held on the network. The financial and computing resources needed to attack the Bitcoin network are so high that it is nearly impossible to hack. No other blockchain comes close to offering that level of security. There’s something to be said about one’s property being safely protected on the most hack-resistant network, and the one most likely to still be here 50 years from now.<br></p><p>But despite those advantages, <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/nft-curious-bet-on-bitcoin-nfts-to-secure-your-digital-legacy#:~:text=building%20NFTs%20for%20Bitcoin%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20easy%2C%20and%20even%20Rare%20Pepes%2C%20while%20innovative%20didn%27t%20have%20the%20opportunity%20to%20take%20off%20on%20Bitcoin%20(Rare%20Pepes%20have%20even%20showed%20up%20as%20%22wrapped%22%20assets%20on%20other%20L1s).">building Bitcoin NFTs</a> was not an easy feat. For example, take <a href="https://rarepepes.com/">Rare Pepes</a>, an early Bitcoin NFT. Rare Pepes are a series of NFTs built around the ubiquitous pepe meme. While innovative, they struggled to really take root and become successful with Bitcoin. Instead, they show up as a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/31/rare-pepe-steeped-in-bitcoin-history-fetches-500k-on-nft-market-opensea/">“wrapped” asset on other L1s</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Is a Bitcoin NFT on the Stacks Blockchain?</strong><br></h2><p>The Stacks blockchain is the first to offer a novel and scalable approach to Bitcoin NFTs. Stacks is the largest and fastest growing Web3 project in the Bitcoin ecosystem. It allows developers to create decentralized apps (dApps) that leverage Bitcoin’s security, decentralization, and capital, all without any changes to Bitcoin itself. You can think of Stacks as a separate but connected programming layer for Bitcoin.<br></p><p>Through that programmability, developers can create Bitcoin NFTs with royalties and interactive on-chain markets, all through expressive smart contracts that do not clog up the main Bitcoin chain. Instead, those smart contracts exist on the Stacks blockchain, and settle on the Bitcoin blockchain.<br></p><p>In other words, the Stacks blockchain acts as a decentralized ledger that tracks each NFT’s ownership and transaction history, but that data then settles on Bitcoin with every mined Bitcoin block, which means it inherits the security of the Bitcoin network. If you wanted to alter the history of Stacks, you’d have to alter the history of Bitcoin too.<br></p><p>Bitcoin NFTs are created and defined in Clarity, the Stacks blockchain’s programming language. Compared to other smart contract programming languages, such as Ethereum’s Solidity, Clarity is <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/smart-contracts-cant-afford-to-fail-and-with-clarity-language-they-wont">optimized for security and predictability</a>. Clarity also makes the source for every smart contract publicly readable on the blockchain, so developers can borrow contracts from other NFT projects to build their own.<br></p><p>In terms of basic building blocks for developers, <a href="https://github.com/friedger/sips/blob/main/sips/sips/sip-009-nft-standard.md">SIP-009</a> defines the standard for NFTs on the Stacks blockchain. Each NFT is always associated with a single smart contract. Within the smart contract, NFTs are listed numerically, starting at 1. The must-have traits and functions are defined in the standard as well, including a unique identifier and other metadata. However,&nbsp; NFTs are not limited to possessing only the traits and functions mentioned in the SIP. We welcome innovators.</p><h2><strong>Why Build NFTs for Bitcoin?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Prior to the creation of the Stacks blockchain, Ethereum provided smart contract functionality to developers when Bitcoin could not. Despite that, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp">Bitcoin has remained the largest cryptocurrency</a>. Bitcoin has appeal as a store of value and has proven itself as the decentralized money layer for the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s the oldest blockchain, and Bitcoin has never been hacked. It’s advantageous to create NFTs backed by Bitcoin for these two reasons. You gain access to all of the money and users currently in Bitcoin’s ecosystem, <em>and</em> you can leverage Bitcoin’s security. Couple these advantages with new scalability and programmability thanks to Stacks, and Bitcoin NFTs are poised to take over the NFT market.</p><h2><strong>Moving Forward With Bitcoin NFTs on Stacks&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When creating NFTs, smart contracts, or apps for Bitcoin, it’s reassuring to know that their value will be preserved because Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. Stacks brings your projects scalability, which means it can scale up or down in performance or cost in response to your needs.</p><p>Hiro is a key contributor to the Stacks ecosystem. At Hiro, we work hard to give developers the tools they need to create, deploy, and use apps and smart contracts within the Bitcoin ecosystem. We specifically designed developer tools to enhance Bitcoin’s programmability through the Stacks blockchain.</p><p>Join us and become a part of this growing and thriving creative community.

When we first saw the signs of hypergrowth for the Stacks ecosystem, we knew we had to rethink our plans and executive team structure to meet the new opportunities and challenges coming toward us. Just one year after launching, the <a href="https://from0to.hiro.so/">Stacks ecosystem has outpaced</a> the community’s wildest expectations: from 0 to 350+ million monthly API requests, 50,000 Hiro Wallet downloads, 2,500 Clarity smart contracts deployed, and dozens of companies launched. We’re now the largest and fastest growing Web3 project on Bitcoin.</p><p>Continuing to support developers, app builders, and Stacks startup founders from this stage to the next requires us to think bolder and bigger. That’s why in addition to becoming Hiro’s Executive Chairman, Muneeb has become CEO of Trust Machines, a new independent Stacks ecosystem entity that builds valuable Bitcoin applications as well as absorbs and helps other application teams at early stages. Trust Machines is coming out with a fresh round of funding — $150 million — to support the growth of the larger ecosystem.</p><p>Muneeb has always been a Day 1 builder. Now that Hiro has found its core purpose and has built a stellar management team to continue the mission, Muneeb can focus on other parts of the ecosystem to help Stacks teams grow and thrive.</p><p>Hiro, meanwhile, will double down on building new developer tools and services the ecosystem needs to turn vision into reality. Muneeb and the full board believe Alex’s deep experience with building developer products, including launching and growing Stack Overflow for Teams, combined with Diwaker’s outstanding technical leadership and long history with Stacks are essential to getting us there.</p><p>We’ll also be doubling down in terms of team growth: We’re doubling the team this year, and are about to kick off a massive hiring period. <a href="https://www.hiro.so/careers">Come talk to us</a> if you want to help build Stacks developer tools.</p><p>We’re looking forward to another incredible year for Stacks, Hiro, and Trust Machines in 2022, and we can’t wait to see what other exciting developments will come from the Stacks community.<br></p>',

        '<p>On this Hiro’s Journey edition, we sat down with Eugenia (Ginny) Digon, Hiro’s first Brand Designer. She joined our team a year ago to help define and work on the visual and brand identity of the company. She’s also involved in marketing and <a href="http://hiro.so/blog">content</a> initiatives, and every now and then gives a hand on the visual design of our <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet">products</a>.</p>',
      name: "The Hiro’s Journey with Eugenia Digon",
      "post-body":
        '<h2><strong>A View Into a Designer’s Crypto Journey</strong><br></h2><p>Probably like many others, Ginny discovered crypto through a friend that wouldn’t stop talking about it. But at first she kept pushing it off because it was “too complicated” and “hard to grasp,” saying she would take care of diving into crypto later when she had more free time. After various attempts by her friend, Ginny finally gave in. They sat down one hot summer afternoon in Toledo, Spain, and she asked him to explain everything, starting from zero. And then down the rabbit hole she went, like many of us after we started <em>getting it</em>.<br></p><p>The fact that Ginny had this early rapprochement with crypto helped spark her curiosity when she stumbled upon Hiro’s search for a Brand Designer—it’s not overly common for an early-stage crypto company to hire brand designers. In reality, most crypto companies only consider hiring for creative roles once they’re well established. For her, the fact that Hiro was looking for a Brand Designer at this stage signaled the maturity and thoughtfulness of the company towards its own growth, and a strong long term vision.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So Ginny applied, met the lovely people of Hiro through our interviewing process, and ultimately got the job. Her favorite part of the interviewing process was meeting so many different people on the team outside of her future manager and the hiring team. She spoke with engineers, growth team members, and Muneeb, Hiro’s CEO and the founder of Stacks, so she could develop a comprehensive view of what the team and culture were all about.<br></p><p>Once she started, Ginny dug in even deeper into crypto - now not only as an outsider or as an investor, but as an active contributor who needed to understand the technology and its potential. Only with that understanding could Ginny use her design expertise to maximum effect.&nbsp; It was during this research phase that the power of cryptocurrency finally finished clicking.<br></p><p>You see, Ginny lived most of her life in Argentina where there is a perpetual and cyclical financial crisis. She saw how the Argentinian Peso lost value over time in disastrous ways and through crazy inflation. She experienced—and suffered—the flaws of government-managed currency in real life, and intimately understood the need for crypto and its transformative technologies. She saw crypto as a way to improve countless lives through the power of economic freedom.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And today, things have come full circle for Ginny. She became <em>that</em> friend, the one who insistently advocates for crypto and the technology behind it. “Do not wait another day!” Ginny told me. “Even if you’re not ready to invest, even if it seems scary, or complicated, or strange... just start to learn about it from an educational standpoint - learn about the alternatives it offers and its power for transformation, which is where the true value lies.”<br></p><p>“It will make you open your mind to new ways of seeing the world - it will make you question why we live the way we do and interrogate the relationship we have with money, and how we want that relationship to be.”<br></p><p>Who\'s up for a fun existential crisis about money?</p><h2><strong><em>So, Ginny, how does this all tie into brand design and your role? What are your thoughts about designing in the crypto space?</em></strong><br></h2><p>In my previous roles, I worked in traditional tech startups and companies. Unfortunately, in that space there are formulas and common patterns we, as designers, fall into, since it’s “the way everyone’s doing it.” There’s this feeling that everything’s done already, and there’s no more terrain to explore.<br></p><p>However, what I find fascinating about designing in the crypto industry is that there are no proven successful formulas. Everything’s still so new and different, and there’s so much room for exploration, trial and error, and for solving communication problems in alternative ways. There is the opportunity to create totally new ways to engage with audiences, which are also very different from the audiences in more traditional spaces in tech.<br></p><p>For example, design in traditional tech might revolve around a product or a service first and foremost, whereas in crypto, the community comes first. Then, you are thinking through the project design and how it fits around the community, and even more broadly, how the design fits into the world view and ideals that this community has in common.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To add to that, there’s also this overall sense of community and togetherness within the industry at large. Even if we’re working on different projects - in the end, we all want for the crypto space to succeed.</p><blockquote>This is another crucial differentiator from traditional tech because in crypto, competition only makes us want to improve and be better at solving problems, and through that, elevate the whole industry. It’s the wagmi mentality. If one of us wins, we all win.<br></blockquote><p>One of the values at Hiro is “We go together,” and the idea is that rising tides lift all boats. There is so much collaboration, a sense of community, and almost everything is built on the basis of open-source philosophy. As a designer, that puts me in a very different design space than the dog eat dog mentality of traditional tech.<br></p><h2><strong>Sounds like you’ve done a lot of work to understand the space. How do you approach research?&nbsp;</strong><br></h2><p>It really depends on the project, but in general, I try to do a bit of research every day. Whether it’s reading books and articles, keeping up with news, or paying attention to what’s happening in our community, I try to stay on top of the dialogue because crypto as a whole is dense and moves quickly. And given how important community is, doing that research is critical to engage with them and understand their pain points and their perceptions.<br></p><p>On the creative side, I also do “research” everyday, mostly through finding inspiration or learning something new. I believe creativity is a muscle that you need to exercise, and is not something that just happens magically. Pablo Picasso put it more poetically when he said, “inspiration exists, but it has to find you working.”<br></p><h2><strong>What are you working on next?&nbsp;</strong><br></h2><p>We just finished our website revamp, which serves as a foundational base for a bigger project: Hiro’s brand evolution. This evolution started last year when we created and grew our marketing team, bringing in our powerhouse VP of Marketing, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlinpike/">Kaitlin</a>, plus two more incredible additions: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elenasgiralt/">Elena</a>, our Product Marketing Manager, and you <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-crawford-141624b3/">Max</a>, our new Content Marketing Manager (and we’re also hiring for a <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/hiro/ee78f6f5-354e-4a61-b8a7-5d7abc732f1d">Marketing Operations Manager</a>!).<br></p><p>I am looking forward to collaborating with our team to do more research on our audience, find our tone of voice, and establish the best way to communicate our products, so we can reach more developers that want to be part of the Bitcoin economy and ecosystem.<br></p><h2><strong>NFTs on Bitcoin are huge right now. Do you own any NFTs? Would you consider designing any?&nbsp;</strong><br></h2><p>I do own some NFTs! I somehow ended up with a <a href="https://stxnft.com/eugenia.btc">cowboy-themed NFT collection</a> which I’m <em>very</em> proud of. A couple months ago I also designed the first official <a href="https://stxnft.com/collections/SP3M7N9Q9HDRM7RVP1Q26P0EE69358PZZAX4MD19Q.nft-nyc-exclusive">Hiro NFT</a>. It was part of a campaign we did for NFT.NYC to onboard developers in the experience of Bitcoin NFTs. What I found thrilling about this project is that we took NFTs to the ‘real’ world. I designed the NFT, and our team made a physical campaign by handing out postcards with a code to claim the NFT. The 1000 units were gone within hours! I still haven’t launched a collection on my own, but who knows, maybe in the future!<br></p><h2><strong>What are other projects you enjoyed working on?</strong><br></h2><p>It’s hard to choose because there were so many I enjoyed and all of them have been challenging in their own way. I enjoyed working on a new illustration system for the <a href="http://hiro.so/wallet">Hiro Wallet</a> to help enhance the user experience and make it more cohesive. Our first <a href="http://from0to.hiro.so">Stacks anniversary wrap up</a> was also very fun to work on - can’t believe we ideated and executed this campaign in less than a week!<br></p><p>I also love doing illustrations for <a href="http://hiro.so/blog">our blog</a> because it’s more heterogeneous and allows for a bit of experimentation, and in the past I also enjoyed working on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HiroSystems/videos">Stacker Chats</a> mini brand.</p><h5>To work with Ginny on design, or check out any other roles, visit our <a href="https://www.hiro.so/careers" target="_blank">career page</a>. <br></h5>',

      "post-body":
        '<p>Current programming languages for smart contracts lack the capacity to enable developers to build secure decentralized applications. One of the reasons for this weakness is that smart contracts are only as secure as their underlying blockchain platform. Secondly, hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the smart contract code, such as reentrancy, bad randomness, and time manipulation, in order to steal funds.</p><p>In this post, we discuss the <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity language</a>, the open-source programming language of the <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks blockchain</a>, and how it enables developers to write smart contracts secured by Bitcoin.</p><h2><strong>The Crypto Industry Can’t Afford the Failure of Smart Contracts</strong></h2><p>Smart contracts are the foundational blocks of web3. They enable applications built on top of blockchains and power DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and any other decentralized solutions you can think of. Since smart contracts are the cornerstone of blockchain applications, when they fail, the applications built with those contracts fail, and the entire ecosystem suffers.</p><p>Blockchains are a fundamentally different programming environment, which leads to new problems. For instance, bugs in smart contract code are almost impossible to fix because code on blockchains is immutable (by design). Today, existing smart contracts are exposed to varying degrees of <a href="https://stacks.org/bringing-clarity-to-8-dangerous-smart-contract-vulnerabilities/">risks, bugs, and vulnerabilities</a>, and these bugs and vulnerabilities have real-life repercussions in industries with live use cases for smart contracts.</p><p>For instance, the DeFi sector, which is powered by smart contracts, is consistently being targeted by hackers. Blockchain Analytics company Elliptic reported that the DeFi industry recorded about $12B in losses in 2021, and as much as<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/hubfs/downloads/The%20Elliptic%202022%20DeFi%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=Regulation%20%7C%20FATF%20%7C%20Oct%202021&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=184080622&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_VKnSJ2M8do18sFVHB_3iRn67gFUyAYbdT6nkabGMUez5sgzJwxod_KOlaKZjiE1Z35Pg6N_FCaFBtES-XMaPOX-C5pQ&utm_content=184080622&utm_source=hs_automation"> $5.5B was lost through code exploits</a>. One such code exploit includes the BurgerSwap incident, in which an <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106457/missing-line-of-code-leads-to-7-2-million-exploit-of-dex-burgerswap">omission of a single line of code</a> in the smart contract led to a $7.2M hack. In another, a hacker <a href="https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/">exploited the Proxy Lock Contracts</a> of Poly Network across three different chains — Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon — to steal $611M, in what is the largest single hack in the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>As decentralized solutions continue to gain increased adoption across multiple industries, hackers will be more active in their search for smart contract vulnerabilities to exploit. And the stakes are higher than just stolen funds.</p><h3><strong>Insecure smart contracts will have regulatory repercussions</strong></h3><p>Not only do hacks create the obvious problem of stolen funds, but they introduce more volatility to an already volatile space. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341287283_When_the_blockchain_does_not_block_On_hackings_and_uncertainty_in_the_cryptocurrency_market">research paper</a> by Klaus Grobys, a professor of financial economics, found that the price of Bitcoin and Ether became more volatile in the wake of a hack.</p><p>Regulators from around the world have <a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d490.pdf">cited high volatility risk</a> as one of the reasons they advocate for strict rules on the role of cryptocurrencies in the global economy. Unfortunately, that volatility won’t reduce if hackers continue to find vulnerabilities to exploit in smart contracts. Combining volatility with insecurity is a recipe that invites unfriendly regulatory policies. Those policies in turn would stifle innovation and make it more difficult to build decentralized applications.</p><h3><strong>Insecure smart contracts will slow down crypto adoption</strong></h3><p>Right now, the crypto industry is enjoying the inflow of early adopters, tech enthusiasts, and adventurers. However, crypto-assets may struggle to unlock mass-market adoption if the average person is worried about the security of their crypto assets or if they find decentralized apps unusable due to smart contract bugs.</p><p>Similarly, enterprises that adopt blockchain-powered solutions might face legal liability if the smart contracts powering their operations fail. Businesses that have built their brands on decades of reliability may hesitate to adopt decentralized applications if they can’t trust smart contracts to perform their designed function.</p><p>The immutability of blockchain technology makes it difficult to undo transactions, and it is practically impossible to recover stolen funds. If hackers find and exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to recover the losses. Therefore, there is a need in the industry for a programming language that makes it much harder to have bugs in the code, and that can enable tooling to surface vulnerabilities in smart contracts before they are deployed — <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a> excels at this, and it leverages Bitcoin to do it.</p><h2><strong>Smart Contracts Can Be More Secure If They Are Anchored by Bitcoin</strong></h2><p>Smart contract security is partially dependent on the blockchain network on which it is hosted. The consensus mechanism, cryptographic hashing functions, network effects, developer activity, and crypto-economics, among other things, influence the security of blockchains. Of the blockchains in existence today, Bitcoin is the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/04/25/143246/how-secure-is-blockchain-really/">most secure;</a> its security has been battle-tested for a decade, and the capital requirements needed to attempt a successful attack on the network make such attacks unfeasible.</p><p>Other blockchains with robust smart contract mechanisms can’t quite boast the same level of security and reliability as Bitcoin. For instance, Solana was recently a victim of a <a href="https://decrypt.co/81004/solana-back-online-following-downtime-network-restart">distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack</a>, Ethereum Classic has been <a href="https://decrypt.co/40196/hackers-launch-third-51-attack-on-ethereum-classic-this-month">attacked three times</a>, and fallout from the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/50-million-hack-just-showed-dao-human/">DAO hack</a> on Ethereum is still fresh in memory.</p><p>While many of the most prominent blockchains have been hacked at some point in their history, the same can’t be said for Bitcoin, despite it being the longest-running blockchain. That’s by design. Bitcoin was created with a scripting language that makes it difficult to add new features that could introduce vulnerabilities. The <a href="https://bitcoindev.network/bitcoin-script-101/">Bitcoin script</a> is a simple programming language used for processing transactions, and it has limited functionality. As a result, developers can’t write smart contracts on Bitcoin, but with Stacks and the Clarity programming language, they can.</p><p>The Stacks blockchain taps into the security of Bitcoin and functions as a <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/is-stacks-a-layer-1-or-layer-2">Layer 1.5 blockchain</a> in which developers can write smart contracts and build decentralized applications that settle on Bitcoin. Some of the applications already built on Stacks that leverage Bitcoin’s security include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.stackswap.org/home">Stackswap</a> – the world’s first complete DEX built for the Bitcoin network</li><li><a href="https://stxnft.com/">STX NFT</a> – an NFT marketplace for exploring, collecting, and selling NFTs</li><li><a href="https://www.sigle.io/">Sigle</a> – a decentralized and open-source Web 3.0 writing platform for creatives</li><li><a href="https://www.citycoins.co/">CityCoins</a> – a decentralized community engagement platform that gives residents the power to improve and program their cities</li><li><a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom</a> – a global infrastructure supporting decentralized digital identity management to enable self-sovereign identities</li></ul><h2><strong>The Clarity Language: A Toolbox for Writing Secure Smart Contracts on Stacks</strong></h2><p>Developers write smart contracts on Stacks using the <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity programming language</a>. Clarity is a new open-source programming language developed by the Stacks foundation, <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">Hiro</a>, and Algorand, among others, that enables developers to write smart contracts for Bitcoin.</p><p>Since the Stacks blockchain launched in January 2021, Clarity has recorded rapid adoption within the Stacks ecosystem. To date, over 2,500 smart contracts written in Clarity have been published on the blockchain. Here are Clarity’s unique features that empower developers to create better smart contracts.</p><h3><strong>Write secure smart contracts with Clarity</strong></h3><p>Clarity smart contract definition is specified in a LISP language, and since LISP’s syntax is very easy to parse, we can write a compact parser for Clarity programs (this parser is part of the Stacks blockchain). This reduces the surface area for potential bugs within the Clarity interpreter and allows for more sophisticated developer tooling (like the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/new-safety-checks-in-clarinet">Check Checker in Clarinet</a>).</p><p>Clarity also benefits from the time-tested strengths of other LISP-like languages, such as brevity, being easier to reason about (e.g. functions without side effects), and better composability. As a result of these strengths and the compact parser, smart contracts written with Clarity need less code than smart contracts written in other programming languages, and less code reduces the possibilities of bugs in smart contracts.</p><p>Clarity enables developers to write smart contracts secured by Bitcoin because Clarity exposes Bitcoin’s block timestamp as the block timestamp of the underlying Stacks blockchain. Therefore, unlike other smart contract programming languages that are vulnerable to time manipulation attacks, smart contracts written in Clarity will only be vulnerable if Bitcoin’s view of time becomes vulnerable, which is as infeasible as the possibility of hacking Bitcoin.</p><p>Similarly, Clarity is intentionally designed to prevent reentrancy attacks that might repeatedly call into contracts from a single transaction in a bid to corrupt the internal state of the contract. Whereas other smart contract languages, such as Solidity (Ethereum’s programming language), provide an optional [noReentrancy] guard that developers may or may not use, Clarity completely eliminates the reentrancy risk as part of its design.</p><p>You can read more about how Clarity addresses some of the major smart contract vulnerabilities <a href="https://stacks.org/bringing-clarity-to-8-dangerous-smart-contract-vulnerabilities/">here</a>.</p><h3><strong>Write predictable smart contracts with Clarity&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The Clarity programming language has a unique design that differentiates it from most other smart contract languages. Clarity sacrifices some types of functionality (e.g. arbitrary recursion) in favor of decidability, so&nbsp; developers, users, and miners can know with certainty how the execution of their smart contracts will pan out.</p><p>In other words, the language is <em>decidable</em>. Developers can analyze Clarity code for runtime cost and data usage before running the code. This decidability helps developers and users predict how much it will cost to run a smart contract, and they can then make informed decisions to prevent the contract execution from failing in live use cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, with Clarity, there are no compilers, assembly, or bytecode. Smart contracts are broadcast to the blockchain exactly as they were written. This means that both developers and users can audit the smart contract code and know exactly what to expect when the code runs. The fact that Clarity smart contracts adopt the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) principle enhances transparency by making the contracts auditable for both technical and non-technical users.</p><p>Unlike other smart contract programming languages in which most users will have to take a leap of faith and trust the developers, Clarity enables users to confirm that the smart contract code is unaltered from the source code and verify that it is free of bugs or malicious intent.</p><blockquote>The fact that the source for every single Clarity contract is publicly readable on the blockchain has some interesting second-order effects. The first is that the blockchain effectively becomes a “GitHub” for Clarity contracts, where developers can look at and borrow from the code of other proven contracts.</blockquote><p>Secondly, the fact that other developers can look through the code, in turn, raises the bar for quality because developers have a social incentive to write elegant code (no one wants to be the public author of a bad smart contract). Lastly, this trait makes it harder to pull off exploits because whatever an attacker does is visible to everyone else too.</p><h2><strong>The Future of Secure Smart Contracts Is Woven into Bitcoin&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The cryptocurrency industry has its earliest histories rooted in the cypherpunk movement of the 1980s, but in the last 10 years since Satoshi’s whitepaper, blockchains and their decentralized applications have gained mainstream recognition. Bitcoin substantiated the idea of peer-to-peer money, but beyond money, Bitcoin is an inspiration for how decentralized solutions can revolutionize entire industries.</p><p>Some other blockchains have previously hogged the narrative about powering smart contracts, but Bitcoin is the only blockchain that can provide the security component that smart contracts need to be as secure, or potentially more secure, than existing centralized solutions. Through the Stacks blockchain, Clarity enables developers to code smart contracts and build dApps that benefit from Bitcoin’s security.</p><p><em>Clarity language empowers you to write secure, predictable, and complex smart contracts secured by Bitcoin. </em><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/"><strong><em>Get started</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p><p><br></p>',

        '<h2>Accomplishments in Q4</h2><p>In the final quarter of 2021, we had the following highlights to brag about:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Stacks Blockchain</strong>: Hiro engineers worked on <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarity-benchmarking-increasing-stacks-throughput">Clarity benchmarking</a> and supported the <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-012/sip-012-cost-limits-network-upgrade.md">SIP-012 network upgrade</a>. Our team also proposed and implemented a <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/discussions/2825">new fee estimator</a>, which is the first step towards a healthy fee market on Stacks. As a result, both network throughput and transaction fees have more than doubled (<a href="https://stacksonchain.com/dashboards/Transactions-per-Day/14">source</a>).</li><li><strong>API</strong>: We made significant investments in the performance and scalability of the API as well as infrastructure and operational improvements in Hiro’s production API instance (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api/issues/642">a read-only mode</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api/pull/821">CPU profiling</a>, faster auto-scaling, better caching, database optimizations). Together, these changes allowed us to handle transient traffic surges. Our API is now serving 300-400M queries / month.</li><li><strong>Clarinet</strong>: We added some amazing new features for developers in Q4, including a local DevNet (for end-to-end testing), integrated cost-tracking, code coverage and a brand new “<a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/new-safety-checks-in-clarinet">check checker</a>”. We’ve also produced 10 bite-sized videos to help you get started with Clarinet. <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet#screencasts">Check them out here</a>!</li><li><strong>Wallet</strong>: We reduced onboarding friction in the Hiro Wallet by introducing the first fiat onramp via Transak, started working on Ledger support on the web, added telemetry, added better fee estimation&nbsp; and made performance improvements.</li><li><strong>Team</strong>: We grew the <a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/companies/best-places-to-work-nyc-2022">award-winning</a> Hiro team by 18% to build and enhance Hiro tools faster. We also launched a <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">new website</a> to better explain who we are and what we do.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>What We’re Focused On in Q1</h2><p>We’re thrilled by the growth across the Stacks ecosystem in just 1 year since the mainnet launch. We’re excited to continue to support the growing number of developers and teams choosing to build on Stacks for Bitcoin! Supporting the rapid growth in Stacks, and specifically, addressing the needs of high-throughput, low-latency workloads is a top priority for us. Here are some of our focus areas in Q1:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Blockchain</strong>: We plan to launch a usable prototype of <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/discussions/2974">subnets</a> on testnet for high-throughput / low-latency workloads. We intend to further improve fee estimates, improve observability and support Stacks 2.1 work (via <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/pull/53">SIP-015</a>).</li><li><strong>API</strong>: We expect to refactor the API into separate, smaller services to ease the operational overhead and to facilitate better horizontal scaling. We also want to add endpoints for NFTs and further optimize performance.</li><li><strong>Clarinet</strong>: We plan to invest in “explainability,” so developers get actionable feedback and useful guidance to write better Clarity code. We also expect to create more educational resources, and we plan to pilot some new features around debugging smart contract state and “serverless” functions.</li><li><strong>Stacks.js</strong>: We’ve under-invested in this area in the last few months. In Q1, we intend to address critical issues and publish an updated strategy for the future of stacks.js.</li><li><strong>Wallet</strong>: We expect to continue to work on bringing Ledger support to the web wallet, add more fiat onramp providers and explore tighter Bitcoin integration in our Wallets, as well as the Explorer.</li><li><strong>Team</strong>: We plan to continue to expand the Hiro team across all departments. Want to be a part of the largest and fastest growing web3 project on Bitcoin? <a href="https://www.hiro.so/careers">Join our team</a>!<br></li></ul><h2>What We’re Not Focused On</h2><p>As more teams and developers find their way to Stacks, we tend to have many more ideas than we have capacity for (which is a great problem to have!). Here are some areas we are unable to focus on this quarter:<br></p><ul><li>EVM compatibility / Ethereum bridges</li><li>Mobile support</li><li>Data storage<br></li></ul><p>These projects need work, as do others not mentioned here, and we encourage the community to pick these efforts up, and we will support you the best that we can!</p><h2>Let Us Know What You Think!</h2><p><br>If you have any questions about our priorities, <a href="http://stacks.chat/">join us in Discord</a> and reach out to the Hiro team.</p>',

This is a good chance for you to get introduced and learn a bit more about operations here at Hiro. <br></p><p>Even though we’ll do our best to tell you everything there is to know about the role and the company, we encourage you to ask us tough questions — here’s a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I8LXkzSG7Y2xWuCz33tC25mp5zjLmrdbB_oHTmBYCvk/edit">great list of examples</a> if you need some inspiration.<br></p><p>If you’re new to crypto and want some resources to help prepare for the call, here’s yet another <a target="_blank" href="https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/">great list of resources</a>.</p><h3>1. Initial Screener</h3><p>The first Hiro face you’ll see is someone from the Talent Acquisition team. This is a 30 minute call to talk about you and your experience, and give you the chance to ask us preliminary questions. We’ll be particularly interested in hearing more about your interests and why you’re curious in Hiro as a possible next step in your career.</p><h3>2. Manager Screener</h3><p>After the initial screen, you might move to a 30-45 minutes call with your potential future manager or a key stakeholder who is more knowledgeable about your particular potential role.<br></p><p>In this call, we’ll be diving into more detailed role specific questions to evaluate whether you’d be well suited for this position. This is your opportunity to learn more about your future team, inquire about the day to day, and anything else on your mind to make sure we are the right fit for you. <br></p><p>To prepare for this interview, make sure you can clearly articulate your previous experience, what you are looking for in the next steps of your career, as well as why you’d like to join Hiro!<br></p><p>This meeting might take place 1 or 2 days after the initial screen, depending on scheduling. </p><h3>3. Tech Screener</h3><p>Whether you have a call with the hiring manager or not, you will go through a technical screen for any engineering role. Expect this last step of the screening session to be scheduled 1 or 2 days after the previous call.</p><p>The technical challenge is a 1 hour live coding exercise. This is the only time we’ll be asking you to code during the whole interview process.</p><p>You will share your screen and work on <a href="https://coderpad.io/">Coderpad</a>, a web-based editor, to solve a problem that we will present to you using the programming language of your choice. If you get stuck on syntax, or forget the API for a certain library, feel free to use Google like you normally would, and you can of course ask the interviewer any questions you like.</p><p>If you’d like to practice for this interview, we recommend trying out <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> or <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>. Don’t expect anything too complex! We are not testing for a deep knowledge of algorithms and data structures, but would rather like to get a sense of how you approach new problems.</p><p>This is your first interaction with one of your future team members, so you can ask more questions to evaluate fit for you.</p><p>Full disclosure, there is no such thing as a perfect coder! The coding exercise is not purely to evaluate the quality of code you write. We want to see your creative thinking, problem solving, and general approach to engineering. Even if you cannot complete an assignment in its entirety, we want you to talk through any obstacles or issues to demonstrate resilience and understanding.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:746px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="746px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6138d117532f37259d0ade36_image%20169.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h1>➰ Full Loop</h1><p>Moving forward to the Full Loop, your talent acquisition partner will reach out to you for scheduling. This portion of the process has 3 interviews plus 1 wrap up, and it usually takes place in 1 or 2 days. <br></p><h3>The steps are:</h3><ul><li>Project Deep Dive</li><li>Architecture &amp; Design</li><li>Values Interview</li><li>Wrap up<br></li></ul><p>This virtual onsite will be done via Zoom and will last around 3.5 hours total. It may be all at once, or broken into two days. While we don’t have explicit breaks scheduled between interviews, we will be happy to pause and let you take a few minutes to take a break, gather your thoughts, or get a coffee. Just let your interviewer know. Or, you can work with your Talent Acquisition Partner to find a schedule best for both sides. </p><h3>1. Project Deep Dive - 60 Minutes</h3><p>This is your chance to shine! You’ll be presenting to 1 or 2 people from the team and we’d like to hear about the most complex, challenging or impactful project you’ve worked on.<br></p><h3>We recommend covering:<br></h3><ul><li>What was the problem you were trying to solve, why was it important, and what made it hard or challenging?</li><li>Why the project was taken on and its intended contribution to the business.</li><li>Enough context around the business and technology for the interviewers, who are software engineers or product managers, so they may follow along.</li><li>A walk through different trade-offs or options considered in design and an explanation of the specific choices you ultimately went with</li><li>A narrative of how the project was designed, initiated, implemented, and finished. If the project is ongoing, that is fine too! Take in consideration the non-technical aspects of projects too: communication, collaboration, interacting with stakeholders, decision making process, etc</li><li>If this was a team effort, what was your role and how were your interactions with the rest of the team.</li><li>Retrospective of how the project went, how you addressed challenges that popped up along the way, what went well, what could be improved.</li></ul><p>We will evaluate for collaboration, impact, and clear communication.</p><h3>2. Architecture &amp; Design - 60 Minutes</h3><p>For this interview, you will meet with a senior engineer to discuss the requirements for a mid to large size project related to what we do everyday. The goal is to collaborate with the interviewer to come up with a solution.<br></p><p>This is a problem solving exercise where you should feel for what it might be like to whiteboard with a colleague on an actual problem. Expect to talk through the design for the project, implementation details, options, and tradeoffs. To express your ideas you might end up drawing a diagram on a Zoom whiteboard or writing pseudo-code in <a href="https://coderpad.io/">coderpad</a>. Having said that, this is not a programming interview and we don’t expect you to write correct code that compiles.<br></p><p>You\'ll be evaluated based on communication and understanding of the problem to solve, the structure of your approach and comprehension of tradeoffs.</p><h3>3. Values Interview - 45 Minutes</h3><p>This is a behavioral interview with two experienced team members where we will ask you questions related to our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/careers">values</a>. Hiro’s values are: </p><ul><li>We empower developers.</li><li>We find a way.</li><li>We have a bias for action.</li><li>We engineer moonshots.</li><li>We go together<br></li></ul><p>In preparation for this stop, we highly recommend reading our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/careers">careers page to get to know our team, mission, and values.</a></p><h3>4. Wrap-up - 30 Minutes</h3><p>For this portion, you’ll meet with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diwakergupta/">Diwaker Gupta</a>, Hiro’s VP of Technology, to go over any remaining questions or to go deeper into something we\'ve missed. We encourage you to ask questions throughout the process. This step is a good opportunity for you to ask high level questions about the engineering organization, as well as organizational goals and aspirations.</p><p>‍</p><h1>💬 Talk With CEO or COO</h1><p>Two or three days after the Full Loop, you’ll be contacted about the final step of getting on a call with our <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/muneeb?s=20">CEO, Muneeb Ali</a> or our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexlmiller/">COO, Alex Miller.</a>‍</p><p>They would want to get to know you, how you learned about us, and how you feel about Hiro and the blockchain/crypto industry. This is a great time to ask questions to the highest of our leadership team! </p><p>‍</p><h1>🎉 Offer</h1><p>A few days after your last interview we will met for a “debrief” session on your candidacy. During this meeting, we will discuss your interviews, and we will deliberate on whether to move forward with an offer.<br></p><p>Once a decision has been made, you’ll be notified immediately and be invited to a call with your Talent Acquisition partner and the hiring manager for the good news! <br></p><p>Once an offer has been accepted and start date set, Hiro equips you with all the tools, software, and resources you need to hit the ground running. All new hires have an onboarding buddy, educational curriculum for the first few weeks, and even a stipend for remote-work equipment! We ensure all new Hiros are comfortable, plugged-in, and have the environment they need to make a big impact. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:746.5px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="746.5px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6138d1d378e2516f19ed1c3b_Group%205081.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Are you ready to start your journey with Hiro? </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/careers#open-positions"><strong>Check our open positions</strong></a><strong> and apply today!</strong></p>',

Yet despite these issues, the world is becoming more digital by the day.</p>',
      "post-body":
        '<p>The global economy is shifting away from physical goods to services, digital goods, and the knowledge economy. As more economic activities shift to digital mediums, decentralized financial solutions powered by blockchain will become central to enabling security and trust in an untrusting world.</p><h2><strong>Digital Economies Require Reliable Digital Currencies</strong></h2><p>As the global economy becomes increasingly digitized, services have started to overtake goods in terms of contributions to the global economy. In 2019, McKinsey reported that the flow of services and data now plays a much bigger role in the global economy, and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/innovation-and-growth/globalization-in-transition-the-future-of-trade-and-value-chains">trade in services grew more than 60% faster than the trade in goods</a> over the past decade.</p><p>Yet despite the increasing digitization of the economy, currencies have not experienced a similar evolution. Today, central banks play zero-sum games through <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/10116/583150BRI0EP430BOX353797B01PUBLIC1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y">currency wars</a> in their bid to improve their economic standing at the expense of other countries, and fiat currencies still need to eventually settle in cash. They aren’t natively digital, which makes them inefficient as a means of exchange in a fully digital economy.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies are more suited to facilitate the transfer of value in a digitized global economy because they are designed for the digital world. Cryptocurrencies exist as code with near-instant settlement. Bitcoin, by far the <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2308/bitcoin/#dossierKeyfigures">most popular cryptocurrency</a>, has all the key pieces aligned for it to become a lynchpin in the global economy. Here’s why.</p><p>Bitcoin has the best brand appeal. It’s becoming a household name, and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-addresses-one-satoshi-40-million/">more than 40 million people</a> own at least one Satoshi (0.00000001 Bitcoin).&nbsp; Bitcoin’s security is unassailable, and in the first decade of its existence, Bitcoin has never been hacked. That’s a powerful fact for an open-source software worth <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">nearly $1 trillion</a>.</p><p>Bitcoin is also fully decentralized without being subject to a foundation, corporation, or government, and it is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp">deflationary in nature</a>. Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million BTC, and the demand and supply dynamics of Bitcoin make it a powerful hedge against inflation.&nbsp;</p><p>Another factor that positions Bitcoin for increased relevance in the global economy is its rising adoption across sectors and economies. For instance, 42 institutions now <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/btc-balance-sheets-42-companies-hold-1-3-million-bitcoin-worth-more-than-65-billion/">hold more than 6%</a> of the total Bitcoin supply. Likewise, Bitcoin has recorded an <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-adoption-surged-880-in-one-year-emerging-markets-lead-the-way-2021-08-19">880% surge in adoption</a> across emerging economies, and its legal tender status in El Salvador has <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/el-salvador-officially-adopts-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-but-will-other-countries-follow/">started the conversation </a>about Bitcoin’s potential as the next global reserve currency.</p><p>Why is Bitcoin able to achieve this growth? Let’s take a step back and talk about the technology behind it.</p><h2><strong>A Refresher on Blockchain and the Bitcoin Ecosystem</strong></h2><p>A blockchain is a digital, decentralized, public ledger that exists across a distributed network. The blockchain stores information in “blocks” of data, and each new block of data also contains the history of every block that came before it, in the “chain.”&nbsp;</p><p>One of the key selling points of blockchains is that they store information transparently, securely, and immutably on a public ledger. On a blockchain, anyone can find relevant details about wallets and transactions using a block explorer, and all the data is stored with end-to-end encryption secured by cryptography.&nbsp; There is no middleman to verify transactions. Everything is public.</p><p>The participants on the blockchain also have private keys that serve as personal digital signatures, and it is impossible to falsify records because each transaction is linked to a unique cryptographic signature. Attempting to alter the data stored on the blockchain will invalidate the hash (a cryptographic proof), and other participants in the blockchain could see the attempt as an act of bad faith and route around it.</p><p>The entire history of the blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. What qualifies as a node varies across different blockchains, ranging from <a href="https://decrypt.co/55510/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node-on-a-raspberry-pi-2021">Raspberry Pi</a> and regular computers to high-end dedicated servers. The nodes in a blockchain network stay connected and communicate with each other about the latest state of the blockchain. One of the key features of decentralization in public blockchains is that there are no permissions to add a node to the network; anybody can set up a node and join the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto’s <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">whitepaper</a> established the model for a blockchain that can power the peer-to-peer transfer of value without traditional financial intermediaries. After all, <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-caused-2008-global-financial-crisis-3306176">the actions of those intermediaries led to the 2008 global financial crisis</a>. A year after the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper, Bitcoin launched as the first implementation of blockchain for the trustless transfer of value.</p><p>Since that launch, Bitcoin has proven to be an inspirational success, showing that monetary supply can be free from centralized control. Other cryptocurrencies have emerged, building on Satoshi’s original idea of decentralized money, but Bitcoin is still the leading cryptocurrency by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1269669/bitcoin-dominance-historical-development/">market dominance</a> with a market cap of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">nearly $1 trillion</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Using Blockchain: Trustless Transactions Through Smart Contracts&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The emergence of smart contracts extended the application of blockchain beyond facilitating the transfer of value and recording the truth of those transactions. Through smart contracts, blockchains now had programmability, so that you could set conditions on when a transaction would be executed.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Bob can send 1 BTC to Alice as a peer to peer transfer. The Bitcoin ledger will record the "truth" of that transaction to show that Bob sent Alice 1 BTC, and there\'s an immutable record of that transfer on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart contracts come into play for “complex” transactions. Let’s take the same example above, but now Bob is obligated to send 1 BTC to Alice only if she scores 700 on her GMAT test.&nbsp;</p><p>How can Alice be sure that Bob will send her 1 BTC? She assumes risk to trust the following:</p><ol><li>Bob has 1 BTC&nbsp;</li><li>Bob won\'t use that 1 BTC for other purposes before her GMAT score is ready&nbsp;</li><li>Bob will keep his word and send 1 BTC if she scores 700&nbsp;</li></ol><p>A blockchain alone can only provide Alice security on the first of those 3 conditions: that Bob has 1 BTC. It can’t enforce the terms of the agreement, the second and third condition.</p><p>However, a smart contract can provide that security because the conditions of the agreement are written in code that is autonomously evaluated and executed. Alice doesn’t need to trust Bob; she only needs to trust the smart contract.</p><p>This ability to program complex conditions into smart contracts has opened up a new world of possibilities for trustless, decentralized solutions, with the most notable innovations being decentralized finance (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835">DeFi</a>), decentralized autonomous organizations (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-a-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work">DAOs</a>), and non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">NFTs</a>).</p><p>However, Bitcoin didn’t support the functionality for smart contracts—and this was by design. Bitcoin was first and foremost designed to enable a decentralized, trustless, and immutable record and facilitate the transfer of value.&nbsp;</p><p>To maximize its security, Bitcoin has a limited scripting language, which makes it difficult to introduce new features, change Bitcoin’s code, or add complexities that could, in turn, create new security vulnerabilities. In other words, <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-holds-the-secret-to-solving-the-trilemma-for-blockchain-platforms">Bitcoin’s simplicity is a feature, not a bug</a>.</p><p>The fact that Bitcoin wasn’t optimized for smart contracts excluded it from the early days of decentralized applications powered by smart contracts. Therefore, the ecosystems for dApps have gone on to thrive on other blockchain platforms, and developers have gone to those blockchains to build. For context, <a href="https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2021-f37874efea6d">22% of monthly active developers work on Ethereum</a> (the most popular blockchain for developers in 2021), and only 3.7% work on Bitcoin.</p><p>However, that is changing. Bitcoin is now evolving with the introduction of different innovations and upgrades designed to enable a decentralized economy within the Bitcoin ecosystem. For instance, the <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks blockchain</a>, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-the-lightning-network-in-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work">Lightning Network</a>, and the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/17/after-taproot-whats-next-for-bitcoins-future/">Taproot upgrade</a>, among others, are working to enhance Bitcoin’s programmability, versatility, and scalability. Stacks, in particular, is making Bitcoin programmable by enabling fully expressive smart contracts for the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><h2><strong>The Future of Finance Is in the Bitcoin Ecosystem</strong></h2><p>As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves and matures, Bitcoin could become an important lynchpin in a digitized global economy because its decentralized nature enables a level playing field free from manipulation by governments, central banks, and other agents.&nbsp;</p><p>However, beyond serving as a means of exchange in the global economy, Bitcoin could potentially power DeFi applications as <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> continues to extend Bitcoin’s programmability with fully expressive smart contracts. Stacks is complementing Bitcoin with a smart contract layer to enable developers to build trustless, decentralized solutions in an untrusting world.&nbsp;</p><p>The development of smart contracts for Bitcoin is a game changer, and now developers can build complex financial applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin’s security, deep capital, and network effects could unlock higher confidence in the use of smart contracts to enforce the terms of a predefined agreement trustlessly, impartially, and automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>We are still in the early days of decentralized finance in the Bitcoin ecosystem, but if there’s any single blockchain with the best shot at powering the evolution of finance, it’s Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Interested in building decentralized solutions for the Bitcoin ecosystem?</strong><a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/why-building-for-bitcoin-is-the-future"><strong> Learn more.</strong></a><br></p>',

If it’s not easy to use, billions of people won’t adopt it. How then can developers build applications that solve the blockchain trilemma and are not only decentralized but scalable and secure too?</p><p>For most people, Bitcoin is the entry point into the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It’s commonly described as a “store of value” or “digital gold”, but Bitcoin could become more than that. It could become the base of a thriving ecosystem of decentralized solutions. In this piece, we highlight how the Stacks blockchain enables smart contracts for Bitcoin to birth a new era of decentralized solutions within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><h2><strong>Bitcoin: Origins, Potential, and Limitations</strong></h2><p>Bitcoin was the first blockchain, originally described by Satoshi Nakamoto in his <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">2008 whitepaper</a> before Bitcoin went live in 2009. Over the last decade, Bitcoin emerged as natively digital money that enables the decentralized peer-to-peer transfer of value over a secured network. As decentralized money, Bitcoin has recorded giant strides in its adoption. It now has a market cap of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">nearly $1 trillion</a>. Corporations add it to their balance sheets, and El Salvador even made it legal tender.</p><p>Bitcoin’s success as blockchain-powered money is related to its deflationary economics—Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million BTC. And compared to electronic versions of fiat currencies, the underlying Bitcoin blockchain is a transparent and undeniable source of truth for its supply, transaction history, and records of ownership. Anyone so inclined can verify a transaction.</p><p>Bitcoin has also built a reputation for security. The Bitcoin network has never been hacked, and the financial and computational resources needed to attempt a successful hack make such a venture futile.</p><p>That security and transparency are important because Bitcoin addresses some of the latent socio-economic problems in fiat money, especially as it relates to wealth inequality and financial censorship. For instance, billions of people all over the world are unbanked or underbanked because there’s little incentive for traditional financial institutions to serve them, and as such, they are shut out of the global economy.</p><p>With Bitcoin, anybody with an internet-enabled device can participate in this new monetary system and access new opportunities. Bitcoin proved that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/gold-or-bitcoin-store-of-value-debate-rages-as-bitcoin-grows/">decentralized storage and transfer of value</a> are possible without relying on intermediaries.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while Bitcoin modeled the decentralized transfer of value over a blockchain, there are instances where the simple transfer of value isn’t enough. For instance, we can store an immutable record that Bob sent 1 Bitcoin to Alice, but what if Bob wanted to loan 1 Bitcoin to Alice? In that case, a simple transfer wouldn’t be enough. Bob would need a measure of guarantee on the terms of the loan (i.e. what is the interest rate?).</p><p>To achieve that, developers needed to encode instructions for what conditions had to be fulfilled for the transaction to occur. Those instructions are called smart contracts (do <em>this</em> if <em>that</em>).</p><p>However, because Bitcoin has a limited scripting language (which makes it more secure), it was difficult to add smart contracts directly to Bitcoin’s code. Therefore, developers began to explore other options. In 2013, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/567bb4f069a91a95348fa0b2/t/5ce11f4f0f06d30001ff5402/1558257488828/Intrepid+Ventures+Ethereum-White-Paper-Made-Simple.pdf">Vitalik Buterin described </a>the need to create “<em>a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions.</em>”&nbsp;</p><p>The blockchain Buterin described was the genesis of Ethereum.</p><h2><strong>Second-Gen Blockchains and the Reality of the Blockchain Trilemma</strong></h2><p>Second-generation blockchain platforms such as Ethereum emerged with functionalities for developers to write smart contracts encoded with the conditions for the transfer of value and to autonomously execute those transfers. Similar to BASIC’s <em>IF</em>...<em>THEN</em>...ELSEIF...ELSE control structures, counterparties can use smart contracts to draw up conditional transactions and trust that the transactions will go through if predefined conditions are met.</p><p>The development of smart contract functionality also enabled developers to build decentralized applications on top of complex smart contracts. This unlocked the true value of blockchains and led to entire decentralized ecosystems in finance, gaming, healthcare, ID management, and more.</p><p>As the popularity of smart contracts grew, blockchain platforms had to figure out how to be concurrently secure, scalable, and decentralized — this is <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition">the blockchain trilemma</a>. For instance, CryptoKitties became the first decentralized application to gain widespread attention in 2017, but its popularity came with a cost as its users <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/12/04/loveable-digital-kittens-are-clogging-ethereums-blockchain/">clogged the Ethereum network</a>. Ethereum wasn’t scalable enough. It couldn’t handle the volume caused by CryptoKitties’ popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>And that is the root of the problem. Blockchains are <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/edc40f883b9105aac4e04420cc4d536a">not inherently scalable</a>. At its core, decentralization is powerful because it is resilient. Anyone can verify transactions. Anyone can spin up a node and run a full replica of the code. But that comes with a tradeoff.</p><p>Those nodes need to reach consensus and agree on the state of the blockchain. Therefore, the speed of the blockchain is dependent on the speed of the slowest node. In order to make a decentralized blockchain scalable, builders can either make the blockchain more centralized (fewer nodes to reach consensus) or sacrifice security (reduce the requirements/difficulty of reaching consensus).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That is the nature of the blockchain trilemma. Since it is difficult for blockchains to have decentralization, scalability, and security concurrently, the blockchain trilemma forces developers to make tradeoffs on those three features. So far, the status quo among second-generation blockchains is to optimize for two features.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Integrating the Best of Bitcoin Into Smart Contracts</strong></h2><p>If most of the second generation blockchains have made trade-offs on scalability, security, or decentralization, what does that mean for the future? Smart contracts are only as secure, scalable, and decentralized as their underlying blockchain platforms.</p><p>So where can developers find a blockchain that solves this trilemma? That’s where <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> comes in. Stacks is a next-gen blockchain that brings scalability and smart contracts to Bitcoin. Stacks enables you to write expressive smart contracts and create dApps that leverage Bitcoin’s security and decentralization. Bitcoin has never been hacked in more than a decade of its operation, and the dApps built on Stacks enjoy Bitcoin-grade security. To rewrite Stacks’ history, you’d have to rewrite Bitcoin’s too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Bitcoin has a market cap of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">nearly $1 trillion</a> but <a href="https://defipulse.com/btc">only $16B worth of BTC are locked</a> in DeFi apps through wrapped BTC. There’s a huge amount of latent capital in the Bitcoin ecosystem waiting to be deployed, and Stacks enables you to unlock that capital to build successful dApps.</p><p>It also lets you to tap into a thriving ecosystem. Bitcoin is home to a dedicated community of long-term believers. <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer">38.22 million Bitcoin wallets</a> hold a balance, and more than 60% of those wallets have held Bitcoin for more than one year. With Stacks, you get an opportunity to build decentralized applications that are native to the Bitcoin ecosystem and enjoy Bitcoin’s security, capital, and network effects.</p><h2><strong>An Era of Blockchain Platforms Secured by Bitcoin Begins</strong></h2><p>When blockchain platforms support smart contracts with decentralization, security, and scalability, smart contracts and dApps will be able to compete against centralized legacy systems — and win.</p><p>Stacks solves the blockchain trilemma and extends Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling smart contracts for Bitcoin through the <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity programming language</a> that exists independently of Bitcoin’s limited scripting language.

        "<p>Through the Clarity benchmarking project, engineers at Hiro have lower computed runtime costs across the Stacks blockchain, resulting in fuller blocks and significantly higher network throughput.</p>",
      name: "Clarity Benchmarking: Increasing Stacks’ Throughput",
      "post-body":
        '<p>The latest Stacks network upgrade, version 2.05, resulted in fuller blocks and higher throughput. A critical component of this upgrade involved updating the constants used by Clarity cost functions. These cost functions are used by STX miners to calculate the cost of every transaction, and ultimately determine how densely they can fill their blocks.</p><p>The improved constants resulted in a 300% increase in the average block capacity. The undertaking of calculating these new cost constants was dubbed internally at Hiro as the “cost function benchmarking” project, and in this post, we will cover what we accomplished.</p><h2>Background on Transaction Costs</h2><p>Clarity is the programming language for writing smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. Each block in the chain executes transactions. While some transactions simply transfer value from one account to another, more complicated transactions can run and publish code (smart contracts).</p><p>Executing these smart contract transactions is not free, however. The combined computational cost of a block’s transactions must not exceed the block’s <em>cost limit</em>. This cost limit is enforced to ensure that blocks are mined and processed in a consistent and timely fashion. That way blocks can be processed by nodes running commodity hardware, which ensures that the Stacks chain remains accessible to the public, and the Stacks chain can keep pace with the Bitcoin chain (if Stacks blocks were allowed to take an arbitrarily long time to process, the chain wouldn\'t keep up with the underlying Bitcoin chain).</p><p>To maximize network throughput, STX miners use <em>cost functions</em> to determine the computational cost of every transaction and calculate how densely they can fill each block.</p><h3>How Do <em>Cost Functions</em> Work?</h3><p>Obtaining the cost of a transaction that executes Clarity code is done by invoking the <em>cost functions</em> that correspond to each Clarity function that is called. These cost functions compute the approximate cost of executing a Clarity smart contract. Clarity cost functions are simple arithmetic expressions. They are typically either constant values, linear functions, or functions of the form <em>alog(n) </em>+ <em>b </em>or <em>a(nlog(n)) </em>+ <em>b</em>.</p><p>The output of these functions is an object that contains five cost values: runtime, write length, write count, read count, and read length. In practice, most of these costs are constant values, except for runtime. This cost function benchmarking project was concerned with determining these runtime cost functions for different transaction types.</p><p>The runtime cost functions represents the relationship between the size of the input and the amount of compute required to execute the function (aka the runtime cost). These functions can be thought of much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation"><em>Big O notation</em></a> that is often used to describe how an algorithm\'s runtime (or space) requirements grow as the input size grows.</p><p>For the 2.0 release of the blockchain, these cost functions were all deliberately set with excessively large constants. This prevented the network from being overloaded early on in its existence, a precaution we took to account for unforeseen engineering challenges. Through the Clarity benchmarking project, we have obtained more accurate, and generally smaller, values for these constants, which lowers computed runtime costs, resulting in fuller blocks and significantly higher network throughput.</p><h2>The Project</h2><h3>High Level Approach</h3><p>In order to determine accurate runtime cost functions for Clarity, we needed to isolate and benchmark each of Clarity\'s native functions. To do this, we used <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">Criterion</a>, a statistics-driven benchmarking library for Rust. Criterion is a powerful tool for detecting and measuring the performance of Rust code. We were able to use Criterion to benchmark <em>Clarity</em> code because the Clarity virtual machine is implemented in Rust.</p><p>For almost every native Clarity function, we wrote a code generator. Each code generator created a Clarity code snippet invoking the function being benchmarked with a specified input size. Once we generated a Clarity code snippet, we interpreted the code string into an AST (abstract syntax tree), setup an environment for executing the code, and finally executed and benchmarked the code with Criterion.</p><p>Criterion runs a suite of these benchmarks sequentially and automatically runs many iterations of each, taking the average result for a more accurate output. The output of these benchmarks gets stored in a CSV file that is ultimately analyzed to compute each Clarity cost function\'s specific constants. We did this analysis with a Python script that utilizes the scientific computing libraries numpy, pandas and scikitlearn.</p><h3>Benchmarking the Cost Function <strong><em>and</em></strong></h3><p>For a simple example, we can consider the cost function <strong><em>cost_and</em></strong>, which corresponds to a clarity function <strong><em>and</em></strong>. The <strong><em>and</em></strong> function is variadic, meaning it can take any number of inputs, and returns <strong><em>true</em></strong> only if all of its inputs evaluate to <strong><em>true</em></strong>. Here is an example of it being invoked:</p><h6>(and true false)<br></h6><p>The cost function <strong><em>cost_and</em></strong> is linear, taking the form <em>mx</em> + <em>b</em>. This means that the total cost of invoking <strong><em>and</em></strong> grows linearly with the number of arguments supplied. To obtain the constants m and b, we need to benchmark the <strong><em>and</em></strong> function with various input sizes. Then, we fit a line to the measured outputs using a linear regression. The slope of this line is our <strong><em>m</em></strong> value and the y-intercept is <strong><em>b</em></strong>.</p><p>For the cost function <em>And</em>, we collected runtime data for the following input sizes: 1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. We dynamically generated clarity code snippets corresponding to each input size. For example, a code snippet corresponding to input size 4 might look like:</p><h6>(and true true true false)<br>(and true true true false)<br>(and true true true false)<br>(and true true true false)<br>(and true true true false)<br>...<br></h6><p>In order to offset the costs associated with the startup time of the clarity virtual machine itself, we generate these code snippets where the benchmarked function is repeatedly invoked (as you can see in the above snippet). The number of repetitions is controlled by a configurable <strong><em>SCALE</em></strong> parameter. After running the benchmark, we normalized the data to obtain the cost function constants.</p><h3>It Gets Complicated…</h3><p>At first glance, this process seems pretty simple. We just need to write code generators for every Clarity function and benchmark the code, right? Well, yes... But not every function is as simple to benchmark as <strong><em>and</em></strong>. Certain Clarity functions expect some sort of local contract state or global chain state to exist. For example, in order to benchmark the <strong><em>map-get?</em></strong> function, we need a map to have been defined, or in order to benchmark <strong><em>block-info</em></strong>, we need to have some sort of chain state where multiple blocks have been mined.</p><p>For Clarity functions that simply reference local contract state, it is sufficient to run a snippet of setup Clarity code before the benchmark gets run. For some functions like <strong><em>block-info</em></strong> we need to simulate a Clarity "HeadersDB" (the database that stores information about stacks and burn block headers).</p><p>Moreover, there isn’t a one to one correspondence between Clarity functions and cost functions. Some cost functions are used to compute the costs of analyzing Clarity code. For example, there are cost functions associated with type checking Clarity code. Here is a list of the cost functions that are invoked when the clarity function <strong><em>map-set</em></strong> is analyzed.</p><ul><li><strong>CostAnalysisVisit</strong>: cost of calling the function <strong><em>type_check</em></strong>.</li><li><strong>CostAnalysisTypeAnnotate</strong>: cost of setting the type signature of both the key &amp; value type in the type checker’s type map (proportional to the size of the type signature).</li><li><strong>CostAnalysisTypeLookup</strong>: cost of looking up the expected type of the key and value of the map (proportional to the type size of each).</li><li><strong>CostAnalysisTypeCheck</strong>: cost of checking that the key and value are admitted by the expected type for each (proportional to the size of the expected types).</li></ul><p>To create benchmarks for cost functions that didn\'t cleanly correspond to a single Clarity function, we forked the Stacks blockchain codebase and wrote benchmark specific functions that isolated the logic we were trying to measure. We then ran benchmarks on these contrived functions to obtain the constants for these more specific cost functions.</p><h3>Crunching the Numbers</h3><p>The output from running the benchmarking suite captures the measured runtimes for the benchmarks for every cost function, often on a range of input sizes.</p><p>Here is a selected snippet of the raw numerical results (not all possible input sizes nor cost functions are shown below), which are in nanoseconds:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1958px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1958px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61de33b3c5a92d710c29b53b_Screen%20Shot%202022-01-11%20at%204.52.40%20PM.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Before plotting these numbers, we had to transform the raw data. First, we divided all the numbers by the <strong><em>SCALE</em></strong> parameter (which was in this case <strong><em>75</em></strong>) to compensate for the repeat computation performed (described in the earlier section). Second, we needed to normalize the units to correspond to the node\'s notion of "runtime", since that is what we must measure costs in. Ultimately, "runtime" is measured in an arbitrary unit. Each block has a set total runtime limit, which needs to correspond to roughly 30 seconds of execution time. We scaled the data such that this requirement held true.</p><p>For the cost functions that take an input size argument, we plotted the results and obtained a line of best fit via linear regression. We ultimately derived the cost function constants from these lines (you can see the code we used to do this <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-benchmarking/blob/master/cost_estimator.ipynb">here</a>). In order to perform a linear regression on data for cost functions which are not linear (in our case either <em>nlog(n)</em> or <em>log(n))</em> we must transform the X axis of the data with the applicable nonlinear function first.</p><p>Here is an example of one of these plots, for the cost function <strong><em>cost_analysis_iterable_func</em></strong>:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61de348f0754b168fd822593_cost_analysis_table.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>For the same cost functions we gave the runtimes for above, here are the computed constants. These are the same values that were ultimately proposed in SIP-012. “a” and “b” represent the values we substitute in to a generic arithmetic function. For example, if a particular cost function corresponds to the expression <strong><em>cost = alog(n) + b</em></strong>, we would substitute the computed constants a and b into the function to obtain the function relating input size, <strong><em>n</em></strong>, to the cost.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61de352ed97710773111447b_new_constants.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>To put these improvements into context, here is the same table but with the old constants, pre-benchmarking:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61de35425484ea3ff63ae4de_old_constants.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>The Clarity benchmarking project yielded more accurate and mostly smaller constants for all of the Clarity cost functions. The results have been put to use in the newest release of the Stacks blockchain, which aims to increase the throughput of the network. In this case, more accurate cost functions means more transactions in each block, which alleviate one of the current major pain points for developers, miners, and users alike, which is the need for higher network capacity.</p><p>The newest release of the blockchain does not mark the end of this benchmarking project: we will extend the repo in order to calculate cost constants for Clarity functions added to the language in the future. If interested in future developments, you can follow the project <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-benchmarking">here</a>.</p><p>After months of work obtaining these new cost functions, we can\'t wait to see the innovation the 2.05 network upgrade will enable on the Stacks blockchain!</p><p>‍</p>',

They enable a shift from centrally administered institutions to open networks like Decentralized Finance (DeFi). This is possible because blockchain technology is a trustless system. Rather than a central institution verifying “the truth” (such as a bank verifying a wire transaction occurred), a dispersed network of independent nodes verifies transactions through a process called mining.</p><p>Importantly, anyone can choose to become a node and participate in that verification process. It’s open to the public. In other words, smart contract transactions can be delivered automatically without the assistance of a third party, and the public can verify those transactions in a “trustless” process.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Trustlessness is vital for smart contracts because it allows for democratized access to permissionless systems without depending on potentially misaligned third parties. Smart contracts for Bitcoin can handle multi-party agreements. Those agreements are secured by the code, bypassing the need for a third party. But this creates a new question.<br></p><p>Rather than “what third party can I trust?”, we have to think about “which programming language is best for smart contracts?” And in the world of Bitcoin, there are a few options. While Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) and Really Good for Bitcoin (RGB) are meritable scripting advancements for Bitcoin smart contracts, Clarity enables a more robust DeFi and decentralized app ecosystem to thrive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Clarity, combined with the <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks blockchain</a>, provides previously unavailable capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

RGB</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.rgbfaq.com/what-is-rgb">RGB</a>, which stands for “Really Good for Bitcoin,” is a client-side smart contracts system for Bitcoin that operates on layers two and three of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It also works with <a href="https://lightning.network/">Lightning Network,</a> which is a layer two decentralized payment protocol.<br></p><h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4><p>Smart contract data is stored off-chain but relies on blockchain for cryptographic proofs. RGB uses client-side validation. Users are required to keep data (source code) client-side with the risk of losing access. Outside of the final cryptographic seal, the state of a contract cannot be publicly referenced once it has been established.<br></p><h4><strong>Use Cases</strong></h4><p>RGB is currently in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/14/rgb-continues-its-work-to-bring-better-smart-contracts-to-bitcoin/">beta testing</a> and is projected to be used to privately trade NFTs or assets (e.g. the stablecoin Tether). Since transactions through RGB occur off-chain, RGB could improve the privacy and censorship resilience of a stablecoin like Tether, whose on-chain address on blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, can be readily monitored.<br></p><h4><strong>Limitations</strong></h4><p>A global state does not exist in RGB. Without that, there are no network effects for live smart contracts online. Additionally, since these smart contracts are not open source, they cannot be leveraged or built upon by other developers, limiting feedback loops and the growth of smart contracts.<br></p><h3><strong>2. Discreet Log Contracts (DLC)</strong></h3><p><a href="https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf">Discreet Log Contracts (DLC)</a> add a smart contract implementation to Bitcoin operating on preset conditions. These “invisible smart contracts,” as they’re known, are constructed to resemble normal multi-signature transactions on the Bitcoin network.<br></p><h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4><p>DLC establishes blockchain oracles that are simple, safe, and easy to use. Oracles are employed as a third party to complete the transaction by signing the contract corresponding to the outcome’s hash. DLC offers better privacy and more flexible smart contracts without the trust risks of a sidechain. Anyone searching for a transaction on the ledger will not be able to tell if it is a smart contract.<br></p><h4><strong>Use Cases</strong></h4><p>DLC is still in <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/08/19/#crypto-garage-announces-p2p-derivatives-beta-application-on-bitcoin">beta testing</a> with betting as the first use case. However, it could grow to include longing/shorting BTC and settling commodities in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>One example for the betting use case could be the outcome of a football game. If someone bets on the Browns to win over the Patriots, then the future conditions would have to be met in order for anyone to be paid. If the Browns win, then the person who made the bet would receive their payout. <br></p><h4><strong>Limitations</strong></h4><p>Much like RGB, DLC does not have a global state. DLC requires a smart contract off-chain component to handle overhead coordination with parties, which presents scalability issues. What this means is that Bitcoin scripting is utilized without gas assets or a fully expressive smart contract platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The use of oracles in DLC also creates a security weakness. There is a chance that an oracle may fail to report or reach the requisite number of reports to execute payouts.<br></p><h3><strong>3. Clarity</strong></h3><p>On the Stacks blockchain, <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/overview">Clarity</a> is the programming language for writing smart contracts. The Clarity language is fully expressive and helps programmatically regulate digital assets within the Stacks blockchain, like the Stacks tokens or BNS names. With native read access to the Bitcoin network, it gives smart contracts on Stacks a unique purview into activity on the Bitcoin blockchain.<br></p><h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4><p>Clarity is a LISP-based programming language. LISP, or list processing, was designed to handle the manipulation of data strings easily.<br>Clarity code is parsed and committed to the chain in the same way that it was written. There are no compilers that add a layer of complexity and limit readability, which increases contract execution outcome predictability. Smart contracts using Clarity are always human-readable.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Use Cases</strong></h4><p>Smart contracts aren’t required for every decentralized application, but Clarity gives decentralized apps additional capabilities. Some of those capabilities are access control (pay to access), non-fungible and fungible tokens, business model templates, app-specific blockchains, and more. With Clarity on the Stacks blockchain, there are almost limitless possibilities.<br></p><h4><strong>Limitations</strong></h4><p>As a LISP-based language, Clarity is less flexible in terms of the functions that it can perform. For example, recursion is not possible with Clarity, and variables are immutable. While this ultimately makes smart contracts more secure and less susceptible to attacks, it requires developers to take a different approach with building common decentralized applications.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Smart Contracts for Bitcoin Sidechains</strong></h2><p>Bitcoin’s scripting language is highly limited by design and is not as expressive as Clarity. While Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-what-it-means-for-investors.html">Taproot upgrade</a> does improve the script language, it doesn’t solve the smart contract dilemma.<br></p><p>Apart from the solutions described above, some developers are working to bring smart contracts to Bitcoin through Bitcoin sidechains. A Bitcoin sidechain is a self-contained blockchain that may safely move bitcoins within and across the Bitcoin network without requiring the use of a distinct currency.<br></p><h3><strong>1. RSK</strong></h3><p>Rootstock platform, or more commonly <a href="https://www.rsk.co/">RSK</a>, is a Bitcoin Network–secured, general-purpose smart contract platform. The sidechain for Bitcoin on the RSK network enables fully expressive smart contracts using Solidity (the Ethereum programming language) and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) via a synthetic version of Bitcoin.<br></p><p>Bitcoin is tokenized for usage in sidechains and may be converted back to Bitcoin at any time by users. A hardware wallet multisig address holds the Bitcoin collateral on the RSK network.<br></p><p>RSK is a mechanism for repurposing proof-of-work from one blockchain to secure another that is merge-mined with Bitcoin. It works like this: miners add the hash of a new block from another chain to Bitcoin blocks, and then they try to discover the proof of work that fits the Bitcoin network’s difficulty.<br></p><p>In a merge-mined chain like RSK, network security relies on a subset of Bitcoin miners, which introduces centralization and security implications. RSK also uses Solidity (Ethereum’s programming language), which does not have visibility into Bitcoin state (whereas Clarity does).<br></p><h3><strong>2. Liquid</strong></h3><p><a href="https://liquid.net/">Liquid</a> is a federated Bitcoin sidechain that also features expressive Bitcoin smart contracts. Liquid brings programmability to its network through a derived Bitcoin asset. Similar to RSK, a user tokenizes their Bitcoin into L-BTC, which can be converted back into Bitcoin at any time.<br></p><p>This enables transactions to be completed more quickly than transactions settled directly on Bitcoin. However, Liquid is not connected to Bitcoin’s blockchain and has no global state. All transactions occur within the Liquid network, while the underlying Bitcoin collateral is held by the federation’s limited group of trustworthy parties.<br></p><p>In exchange for programmability, Liquid sacrifices decentralization (users rely on third party custodians to hold their Bitcoin) and connection to Bitcoin’s global state (Liquid smart contracts cannot react to the state of Bitcoin’s blockchain).<br></p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Clarity Enables Smart Contracts Within the Bitcoin Ecosystem</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61dcb666bbee30534f08e221_Asset%201%402x.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Clarity is the only smart contract solution for Bitcoin that doesn’t sacrifice decentralization or the ability to react to Bitcoin’s global state. Clarity smart contracts are published directly on the Stacks blockchain in real time as developers deploy them, and all of the code is open source. Clarity does not compile, allowing the original source code for a smart contract to be available for viewing. As a result, anyone may verify where the code for a specific smart contract comes from.<br></p><p>In addition, Clarity is a decidable language, meaning you can predict what the program will do by reviewing the code. In contrast, Solidity, which runs on Ethereum, publishes only the compiled code, meaning it is not readable (to people, anyway), and Solidity is non-decidable, which introduces additional risk for bugs in the code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The benefit of how Clarity publishes code is that it is a fundamentally new system for Bitcoin in which all of the states or data necessary to interact with these contracts is always available on the blockchain. This is a stark contrast when compared to off-chain Bitcoin innovations where that data is not available.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Building Smart Contracts Like Lego Blocks</strong></h3><p>Lego blocks stack together to create a multitude of objects — planes, trains, and even a Death Star. Much like Lego blocks, smart contracts built with Clarity on the Stacks blockchain can be stacked one on top of the other. People can combine and build on these Lego blocks and benefit from the network effects of possessing a live, installed, and ready-to-use network of smart contracts. Anyone can make function calls to use these <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/theres-nowhere-to-hide-with-clarity">smart contracts</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>Why You Should Use Clarity for Bitcoin Smart Contracts</strong></h2><p>The expressive smart contract language solution of choice for Bitcoin is Clarity. DLCs and RGB have demonstrated to be useful in some use cases. However, they are not general-purpose smart contract languages. They are unable to provide you with a live, on-chain network of building blocks as Clarity does.<br></p><p>Clarity is a decidable language (unlike Solidity, which is Turing-complete). This forces developers to build simpler, more secure contracts that perform compartmentalized functions.<br></p><p>Each contract’s source is made public when using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain to construct Bitcoin smart contracts. As a consequence, the executable, uncompiled, and human-readable source code is included in every smart contract released on the Stacks network. This means all Clarity smart contracts are open source, and any developer can review the code of other projects and leverage that code to build something new!<br></p><p>Ready to get started with Clarity? <a href="https://docs.hiro.so/intro">Write a smart contract</a>.<br></p>',

        "<p>Anyone can write a smart contract. It’s harder to write one that is safe and secure. At Hiro, we want to make that easier. In this article, we break down the “check-checker”, a new tool that can help developers identify how and when user data could cause unexpected behavior in their smart contracts.<br></p>",
      name: "New Safety Checks in Clarinet 🚨",
      "post-body":
        '<p>With <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-repl/releases/tag/v0.18.0">version 0.18.0 of clarity-repl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/tag/v0.21.2">version 0.21.2 of Clarinet</a>, we\'ve added a new analysis pass to help ensure that your smart contracts are safe and secure. It\'s called the "check-checker", and this article will explain what it is and how it works.</p><p>In program analysis, we use the term, "tainted data" to describe any inputs to the program that come from an untrusted source, typically the users. Failure to properly manage this tainted data is the cause of most software vulnerabilities. A very simple case of unmanaged tainted data causing a problem in a Clarity smart contract could be something like this:</p><div></div><p><br></p><p>In the above contract, <strong><em>transfer</em></strong> is a public function, so all of the parameters are untrusted. The <strong><em>nft-transfer?</em></strong> call will fail if the sender does not actually own the NFT with the given ID, so we can ignore that for now. However, the developer probably did not intend to let anyone transfer NFTs belonging to others. What\'s missing is a check to verify that the transaction sender is the same as the sender argument to this function. Our new analysis pass is called the check-checker because it <em>checks</em> whether or not untrusted input has been <em>checked</em>. With the check-checker enabled, here\'s what you\'ll see:</p><h6>test:17:36: warning: use of potentially unchecked data<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(nft-transfer? my-nft token-id sender recipient)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^~~~~~<br>test:16:43: note: source of untrusted input here<br>(define-public (transfer (token-id uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal))<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^~~~~~<br></h6><blockquote>"Our new analysis pass is called the check-checker because it <em>checks</em> whether or not untrusted input has been <em>checked</em>."</blockquote><p>To clear that warning, we need to add some kind of check on the untrusted input, sender, before using it in the <strong><em>nft-transfer?</em></strong>.</p><div></div><p><br></p><h1><strong>How does it work?</strong></h1><p>There are three concepts that are important to the of analysis of tainted data:</p><ol><li><strong>Source:</strong> an untrusted input</li><li><strong>Filter:</strong> an expression that checks a source, making it trusted</li><li><strong>Sink:</strong> an expression that must not be passed untrusted data</li></ol><p>In the above example, the <strong>source</strong> is the parameter <strong><em>sender</em></strong>, the <strong>filter</strong> is the <strong><em>asserts!</em></strong> expression and the <strong>sink</strong> is the <strong><em>nft-transfer?</em></strong> call. Sources of untrusted data are any inputs to public functions. This untrusted data spreads like fire through expressions where it is used, making them also untrusted (or tainted), until it is filtered.</p><div></div><p><br></p><p>In the above example, the input amount is a source of untrusted data. Since it is used, unchecked, in the + expression, that expression is now also untrusted, so this would trigger a check-checker warning on the call to <strong><em>stx-transfer?</em></strong>.</p><p>The original example demonstrates using <strong><em>asserts!</em></strong> to filter the untrusted data, but there are several other ways. Note that the system <strong>does not</strong> attempt to be smart enough to guarantee that the <em>correct</em> check is performed to filter the data, only that <em>some</em> check has been performed. It is up to the developer to ensure that the check is correct. The following expressions can be used as filters:<br></p><ul><li><strong><em>if:</em></strong> When the condition of an if expression is tainted by a source, that source is considered filtered afterwards.</li><li><strong><em>and and or:</em></strong> Both of these logical expressions are executed lazily, so they impact control flow in the program. After an expression tainted by a source is used in an and or or expression, it is considered filtered.</li><li><strong><em>asserts!:</em></strong> When the boolean expression of an asserts! expression is tainted by a source, that source is considered filtered afterwards.</li></ul><p>Sinks are places where we really need to make sure that untrusted data is not used. Sinks include all operations that have externally visible results:</p><h4>Actions on Stacks wallets:</h4><ul><li>stx-burn?</li><li>stx-transfer?</li></ul><h4>Actions on fungible tokens:</h4><ul><li>ft-burn?</li><li>ft-mint?</li><li>ft-transfer?</li></ul><h4>Actions on non-fungible tokens:</h4><ul><li>nft-burn?</li><li>nft-mint?</li><li>nft-transfer?</li></ul><h4>Actions on persisted data:</h4><p><strong>Maps:</strong></p><ul><li>map-delete</li><li>map-insert</li><li>map-set</li></ul><p><strong>Variables:</strong></p><ul><li>var-set</li></ul><p>In addition to those, the check-checker is also a bit opinionated and prefers that untrusted data be checked near the source, making the code more readable and maintainable. For this reason, it also requires that arguments passed into private functions must be checked and return values must be checked.</p><ul><li>Calls to private functions</li><li>Return values</li></ul><p>Finally, another opportunity for exploits shows up when contracts call functions from traits. Those traits are untrusted, just like other parameters to public functions, so they are also required to be checked.</p><ul><li>Dynamic contract calls (through traits)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h1><strong>Annotations</strong></h1><p>Since the check-checker cannot perfectly understand the code, there may be safe code that nevertheless triggers a warning from the check-checker — a false positive. False positives are like kryptonite to program analyzers because if developers see a bunch of invalid warnings, then they end up ignoring them altogether. To avoid this problem, we\'ve added annotations that let developers tell the check-checker, "I know this looks dangerous, but trust me, I know what I\'m doing."</p><div></div><p><br></p><p>This <strong><em>allow(unchecked_data)</em></strong> annotation indicates that the expression beginning on the following line should not be checked. No warnings will be reported for that line, so in the above example, even if <strong><em>amount</em></strong> has not been checked, there will be no warning. Note that the annotation is just a magic comment, so if you are not running the check-checker, it does not affect the code at all.</p><div></div><p><br></p><p>The <strong><em>allow(unchecked_params)</em></strong> annotation specifies that the check-checker should not generate a warning if unchecked parameters are passed to the function defined on the next line. This can be very useful if a developer wants to define a private function that acts as a filter — taking unchecked data in, checking it, and returning trusted data. Remember that the return value from such a function will trigger a warning if it is unchecked.</p><p>Both of these annotations are currently a bit broad, in that they apply to all variables/parameters in the targeted expression/function. In future updates, these will be improved with more specific targeting.</p><p>‍<br></p><h1>Usage</h1><p>To try the check-checker, you just need to enable the new analysis pass in your Clarinet.toml file:</p><div></div><p><br></p><p>Then, just call <strong><em>clarinet check</em></strong> as you always do, and you might see some new warnings from the check-checker.</p><p>Remember, this feature is new and is not intended to make any safety guarantees, but it should help. Several well-known vulnerabilities that we\'ve seen in the past would\'ve been caught by this new analysis. We at Hiro want to help you catch future vulnerabilities before they go live!</p><p>Now go and <strong>check</strong> it out (pun intended)! Please open issues for us on<a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-repl/issues/new"> GitHub</a> if you find any missing warnings or annoying false positives, and we\'ll continue to improve.</p><p>If you\'d like to see the check-checker in action, you can also watch Brice give a demo of the Clarinet feature in a <a href="https://youtu.be/v2qXFL2owC8">video on our YouTube channel</a>.<br></p>',

        "<h2>What’s in a Layer?<br></h2><p>Layer 1 blockchains are sovereign systems, meaning that the system can exist without anything else. Bitcoin is a sovereign L1 blockchain. Ethereum is a sovereign L1 blockchain. Layer 2 blockchains, however, cannot exist by themselves. They depend on the underlying L1. For example, Lightning — an L2 —&nbsp; can’t exist without the Bitcoin L1 blockchain.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Of course, the trickier part is defining the difference between a true L2 versus something like a side chain such as Liquid or RSK. The definition of a true L2 is where the L2 layer is benefiting 100% from the security of the underlying L1, which also means that the L2 is actually contained fully within the programming abilities of the L1. Arbitrum is a great example. You can always take Arbitrum fraud proofs to the Ethereum L1, and the L1 will decide how assets are allocated. You're depending on the security of the L1. That's the difference between pure L2 versus a system that is introducing other security assumptions outside of the L1.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Breaking the Mold&nbsp;<br></h2><p>In the Stacks white paper, we used the generally accepted L1 definition at the time to discuss Stacks as L1. This is because Stacks has independent miners as well as a separate security budget in addition to the security benefits that it gets from Bitcoin. However, Stacks is not a sovereign system, as it cannot exist without Bitcoin. It’s also not an L2 because it brings functionality that cannot be implemented with Bitcoin script, specifically fully expressive smart contracts.<br></p><p>Stacks is in an entirely unique space, and thinking of it in terms of Layer 1 or 2 is like fitting a square peg into a round hole. When pressed, I somewhat jokingly reply now that it’s a “Layer 1.5.”</p><div></div><p>This still doesn’t convey the uniqueness and importance of Stacks. The better, more accurate answer regarding “layers” is simply this: Stacks is a programming layer for Bitcoin.<br></p><p>Stacks serves a different purpose than an L2. An L2 can scale L1s, but it's harder to add completely new functionality this way given the limits of the underlying L1 programming ability. A blockchain like Stacks can build upon the security of the L1 while adding additional functionality and potentially open the ecosystem to new apps and markets.<br></p><p>The potential of opening an ecosystem through a programming layer can’t be understated: Bitcoin is a trillion dollars in assets that few people are using for anything other than a store of value. With Stacks as the programming layer, developers and businesses can unlock it to enable Bitcoin NFTs, Bitcoin DeFi, Bitcoin social networks, Bitcoin gaming, and more. This could expand the value of the ecosystem 10 fold.<br></p><p>Imagine if this same potential could be unlocked for all blockchains. We live in a multi-chain world, and I’m intrigued by what other future programming layers could do.<br></p>",

Unparalleled security</strong></h2><p>As DeFi and other decentralized solutions continue to gain increased mass-market adoption, there’ll be a need to guarantee the security of users’ data, digital assets, and transactional activities. Many second- and third-generation blockchains are grappling with security challenges.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For instance, in 2020, Ethereum Classic <a href="https://decrypt.co/40196/hackers-launch-third-51-attack-on-ethereum-classic-this-month">suffered three 51% attacks</a>. Cybersecurity researchers at Atlas VPN reported that there were 12 <a href="https://atlasvpn.com/blog/blockchain-hackers-stole-3-8-billion-in-122-attacks-throughout-2020">successful attacks against blockchain protocols</a> in 2020.</p><p>Bitcoin<a href="https://decrypt.co/46719/how-bitcoins-antifragility-makes-it-almost-unstoppable"> has never been hacked</a> because the financial resources required to hack the network make it a futile venture. Bitcoin has been<a href="https://decrypt.co/46719/how-bitcoins-antifragility-makes-it-almost-unstoppable"> resilient to attacks, shocks, and stress</a> for more than a decade. Building for Bitcoin means that your dApps, DeFi, and tokens are protected by a strong security architecture.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:750px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="750px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61a4b429fd3a7a2abcd23201_Hiro-blog-2-16.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>2. Broad-based adoption driving deep liquidity&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Bitcoin’s economics is driving broad-based adoption. Traditional financial institutions and Fortune 500 companies now <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2021/01/12/what-publicly-traded-companies-have-bitcoin-on-their-balance-sheet---and-why/?sh=2b69f65b4564">hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets</a>. There are now Bitcoin ETFs <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/20/bitcoin-etfs-arent-new-heres-how-theyve-fared-outside-the-us/">in the U.S. and in other countries</a>, and Bitcoin is now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/world/americas/el-salvador-bitcoin.html">a legal tender in El Salvador</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bitcoin’s broad adoption, in turn, enables it to have deeper liquidity than other blockchains. As of November 9, 2021, Bitcoin had a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">24-hour trading volume </a>of more than $40.47 billion. In contrast, Bitcoin’s closest competitors by market cap, Ethereum, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Solana, only have 24-hour trading volumes of $19.30 billion, $2.19 billion, $7.37 billion, and $2.66 billion, respectively.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When you build for Bitcoin, the depth of liquidity in the Bitcoin ecosystem makes it easier to create liquidity pools. These pools could power decentralized lending, trading, and yield generation, among others. The deep liquidity also makes your project more attractive as retail and institutional users enjoy easy entry and exit.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:750px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="750px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61a4b4459c8c466c51d06f4b_ss-16.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h2>‍<strong>3. Universal standard for digital assets</strong><br></h2><p>Bitcoin is already the universal standard for cryptocurrencies. The price of Bitcoin determines the direction of the crypto market. Bitcoin is the main token against which all other tokens are priced.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Dr. Saifedean Ammous, the author of The Bitcoin Standard, observes that Bitcoin could also become the universal standard for the <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/economics-of-bitcoin-as-a-settlement-network/">settlement of both digital and traditional assets</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Bitcoin is money free of counterparty risk, and its network can offer final settlement of large volume payments within minutes,” Dr. Ammous said. “Bitcoin can thus best be compared to settlement payments between central banks and large financial institutions, and it compares favorably to them, being infinitely cheaper and more verifiable. … Bitcoin can support an international network of 850 central banks capable of performing daily final settlement with one another.”<br></p><p>If the prediction that all assets will eventually settle on Bitcoin holds true, then developers will be better served by building their applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than other blockchains. This premise is valid even in a future multi-chain world: making the strongest blockchain the gateway to all others is the best path for cross-chain interoperability. Building for Bitcoin could reduce the degree of separation between the computational layer and the settlement layer of digital currencies.</p><p>‍<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:750px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="750px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61a4b48a4e1fe12a79df278c_Hiro-blog-2-17.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>4. A dedicated community of early adopters, enthusiasts, and advocates</strong></h2><p>When you build for Bitcoin, you access a global community of Bitcoin miners, adopters, enthusiasts, and advocates. It is difficult to collate the number of Bitcoin wallets in the world, and the number won’t be indicative of the size of Bitcoin’s community. The number of Bitcoin wallets with a balance is probably a reliable tool, but it doesn’t account for instances in which one person holds many wallets. Also, it doesn’t account for instances in which a single wallet holds the funds of many people, such as wallets owned by crypto exchanges.<br></p><p>Yet, Blockchain.com, with its <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer">38.22 million Bitcoin wallets holding a balance</a>, provides a glimpse into the makeup of the Bitcoin community. Also, more than 60% of those wallets have held Bitcoin for more than one year.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:600px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61a4b64648c78017cb8ea740_Screenshot%202021-11-29%20at%2008.15.09.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer"><em>Blockchain.com</em></a>‍<br></figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>A 2021 paper, “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3915269"><em>Measuring Utility and Speculation in Blockchain Tokens</em></a>,” published by researchers at the University of Michigan, shows a marked decline in the utility demand of tokens and a corresponding increase in the speculative demand of tokens. The researchers found out that between July 2017 and April 2021, the “utility has continued to decline during and after the crypto winter to about 5% of weekly circulating supply … despite many token-linked platforms claiming to be of real-world use, actual utilization of these platforms has consistently declined ever since the initial ICO boom.”</p><p>The fact that more than 60% of Bitcoiners have been holding BTC for more than a year is a good sign. It suggests that the speculative appetite within the Bitcoin ecosystem isn’t as excessive as it is on other chains. Hence, when you build for Bitcoin, you can expect lower churn because your users won’t be chasing the next pumping project.</p><p><br></p><h1><strong>Here’s How You Can Start Building for Bitcoin</strong></h1><p>Bitcoin has a large, diverse, and untapped market for DeFi. Yet, this potential hasn’t attracted developers because Bitcoin is not easily programmable. Also, Bitcoiners who want to take part in DeFi have to go through centralized exchanges or use wrapped BTC on other blockchains.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> is a next-generation blockchain designed to power smart contracts and decentralized applications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Stacks connects to Bitcoin, it has visibility into Bitcoin’s state, and it enables developers to leverage Bitcoin’s capital, network effects, and security to build decentralized applications that will inherit all the amazing features of Bitcoin.<br></p><p>At <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">Hiro</a>, we create developer tools for Stacks so you can build apps and smart contracts for Bitcoin. If you are ready to build for Bitcoin, here are some of the things you can start creating with our developer tools.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Write fully expressive smart contracts&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>To get started building for Bitcoin, you can explore how to write smart contracts using <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a>. Clarity is an open-source programming language designed by researchers at MIT and Princeton. It provides developers with the predictability and security needed to boost user confidence in smart contracts.<br></p><p>Clarity is an interpreted language in which human-readable source codes for every smart contract are present on the blockchain. Also, Clarity is decidable, and you can expect your code to perform exactly as expected.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Create decentralized applications secured by Bitcoin</strong></h3><p>Stacks provides additional capabilities beyond the core competencies of Bitcoin. But it enables you to build decentralized applications with visibility into Bitcoin’s chain.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Stacks uses innovative solutions such as its Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism and microblocks to enable you to build for Bitcoin. You can now build apps that enjoy Bitcoin’s unparalleled security without needing to modify Bitcoin’s code.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Mint fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</strong></h3><p>Bitcoin provides <a href="https://medium.com/@nic__carter/its-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-5dcd1c3f4e41">provable settlement assurances</a> that make it practically impossible to alter or cancel transactions once settled. You can leverage this settlement assurance to launch tokens and <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/nfts-on-stacks-new-tutorial-and-documentation">NFTs</a> for a wide range of financial services and applications.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By launching tokens powered by Bitcoin, you could speed up their adoption by riding on capital and network effects within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Create and Expand Bitcoin-backed stablecoins</strong></h3><p>You can now mint stablecoins that are backed by a Bitcoin reserve using the Stacks blockchain. <a href="https://arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a> has already launched a crypto-collateralized stablecoin (USDA)on Stacks, and Circle has revealed that<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/06/29/usdc-stablecoin-could-soon-expand-to-10-more-blockchains/"> USDC is on its way to Stacks</a>. Both Arkadiko and USDC model how developers can create or expand stablecoins with Stacks.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your DeFi project doesn’t need you to create a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin from scratch, you can leverage the existing stablecoins on Stacks to provide a means of stable exchange within your project.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Offer Bitcoin-collateralized lending applications&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Bitcoin is an established base settlement layer for digital assets. According to Ruchir Sharma, Head of Emerging Markets and Chief Global Strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Bitcoin has the potential to<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ea33b688-12e0-459c-80c5-2efba58e6f1a"> become a world reserve currency</a>.<br></p><p>As Bitcoin continues to prove that it is a reliable store of value, you can expect that fewer people would want to sell their Bitcoin holdings. This hesitation to sell Bitcoin provides an opportunity to build financial products in which Bitcoin is a form of collateral.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For instance, you can build an application for people to take out a mortgage against their Bitcoin holdings without selling their BTC or taking it outside the Bitcoin network into another chain. You can build DeFi applications for Bitcoin holders to get P2P credit against their Bitcoin. The best part is that the credit history and creditworthiness can be tracked and validated on-chain.<br></p><p>This collateralization enables Bitcoin’s DeFi activities to happen with the Bitcoin ecosystem. It also neutralizes the centralized risk that happens when people deploy their BTC to centralized exchanges to trade. Also, Bitcoin collaterals keep Bitcoin-DeFi activities within the Bitcoin network by eliminating the need for synthetic BTC used for DeFi on other chains.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1079px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1079px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61001f37d9b8a89b4411a7bd_Asset%2028.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h2><strong>Futureproof Your Project by Building for Bitcoin</strong></h2><p>At Hiro, we have built developer tools to extend the programmability of Bitcoin through the Stacks blockchain.

I\'m Gina Abrams and today I\'m joined by special guest <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronBlankstein">Aaron Blankstein</a>, Hiro team member and senior contributor in the Stacks ecosystem. Aaron\'s work has been instrumental in development of the <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain">Stacks blockchain</a>, the <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity smart contract language</a>, and his code is in many repositories for Stacks. Aaron, thank you so much for joining!&nbsp;<br></p><h4>— <strong>Aaron Blankstein:</strong></h4><p>Thank you, Gina. I\'m happy to be here.<br></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Cool. I\'m super excited to have you on today because there is so much work happening to scale Stacks through your work and the Hiro team\'s work. And we\'re going to dive a little bit deeper into that, but to start, I\'m curious about what made you decide to join the Stacks project, this was almost five years ago, above all the other opportunities that you had as a Princeton PhD in computer science?</p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, sure. When I was wrapping up my PhD program, a lot of the work that I had done during my PhD had focused on computer systems, like the way web applications are deployed today, and work around user privacy on the internet, and how we can build more privacy focused applications for users. So a lot of my research had covered areas of how Web 2.0 had gone wrong, like all these applications that people had built, that just ingest tons of user data. And so I\'d always kind of been interested in, I guess, alternative models for how the internet could work or how web applications could work. <strong>At around this time I was contacted by Muneeb and he said, "I have this really great, really far out idea, and I\'d love to talk to you about it."</strong> And over the course of like a hour long conversation, he pitched what at that point was a very pie in the sky idea about a new kind of internet where users are in total ownership of their data.</p><p>Users would have more of a stake in the app applications that are getting built, the applications that they\'re using, and powering all of this was the Stacks blockchain. I don\'t think that it was at this point named, it was just like the idea is that this would be powered by some blockchain and the pitch was, "Hey, come and build this." And I thought to myself this really resonates with a lot of the problems that I\'ve seen on the web as it was then, and still is today. And I thought this sounds like a great project to join. It\'ll be really exciting and maybe we\'ll build something amazing. I\'m glad I made that decision.</p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>What a journey being able to see it from inception all the way to now, when there are lots of applications and production, et cetera. So, can you share a little bit more background on some of the responsibilities you\'ve had fulfilling this vision [for a better internet] through the Stacks blockchain and Clarity?<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, sure. So over time we started to flesh out what the requirements would be from Stacks 2.0, essentially. In the earliest days of the Stacks blockchain and what was previously the Blockstack Project, the blockchain that we had really only supported certain kinds of things like the <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns">BNS (the Blockchain Name Service)</a>, and as we wanted to expand that functionality and flesh out what we wanted out of the Stacks blockchain, we came up with the fundamental designs. And as part of that, we knew that we would need a smart contracting link to enable developers to build the rich applications that they want to build without us predetermining the style of all applications that could be built on blockchain.</p><p><strong>Once we knew we wanted a smart contract language, the question was okay, what is the design of this going to look like, and how is it going to be implemented?</strong> Over time, we hashed out the design of Clarity and I was pretty instrumental in the design of Clarity in particular ensuring that the Clarity language wasn\'t Turing complete, such that it could be analyzed through static analysis to tell you things like whether or not a smart contract function will ever complete, approximately how much it would cost to execute all sorts of things like that. The Clarity type system, I was pretty instrumental in the design of that. And then also the initial implementation work of Clarity for Stacks 2.0 as well as our proof of transfer algorithm.</p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Thank you. And what team do you work on currently at Hiro? And can you also elaborate on the work that\'s done by the Hiro team versus the Stacks Foundation, or other independent entities?</p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, sure. So on the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">Hiro</a> team, I\'m a member of our Stacks platform team, which maybe you\'ll hear called the SPLAT team. I was instrumental in that abbreviation, so point there. <strong>As part of the platform team, I help the Hiro engineers ensure that the developer platform that we have —so this encompasses things like the </strong><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/api"><strong>API</strong></a><strong> that powers the </strong><a href="https://explorer.stacks.co/"><strong>Explorer</strong></a><strong>, as well as developer tools like </strong><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/tutorials"><strong>Stacks.js or clarinet</strong></a><strong> —I help ensure that those things capture the goings of the blockchain work. </strong>And then I also work a lot on proposing changes, and implementing some of these proposed changes in the Stacks blockchain repo, as from the perspective of a Hiro contributor.&nbsp;</p><p>Hiro as a company has views about what features the Stacks blockchain should have. And as part of those opinions we submit <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/tree/main/sips">proposals</a>, those proposals are reviewed by other participants in the ecosystem, like maybe <a href="https://stacks.org/">Stacks Foundation</a>, miners, other people like that. And as those are reviewed, we can work on an implementation. So, while Hiro doesn\'t have full maintenance responsibility of the Stacks blockchain repository, we are contributors to it.</p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Awesome. Thank you. Today in this episode, we\'re going to focus a lot on scalability and ongoing developments in this realm. You bring this unique perspective of the Stacks blockchain, and how it was developed well before Stacks 2.0, et cetera. Can you provide some high-level context to set the stage on scalability in terms of the recent traction that we\'re seeing and some of the associated challenges, and growing pains for the network?<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, sure. So there\'s kind of two important pieces of background when thinking about scalability in the Stacks chain and maybe some of the growing pains that we\'re seeing today. <strong>One of these is that the Stacks blockchain is not unique in this design choice, but it is different from the majority of chains that we see today, which is that the Stacks blockchain is an open membership blockchain, meaning anyone can choose to become a miner.</strong> You do not need to have some certain value of Stacks to participate in the consensus algorithm. You don\'t need to register in a BFT protocol. You can just start mining. So, it\'s open membership. <strong>And then two, much like Bitcoin, the Stacks blockchain views decentralization in a pretty Maximalist way.</strong> And one of these Maximalist views of decentralization is that not only should anyone be able to become a miner, but the compute resources required to follow the blockchain, should remain relatively modest.</p><p>And what we mean by relatively modest is, if you have an off the shelf consumer available computer and a relatively good network connection -- like where you\'re getting over 10 megabits per second on a regular basis, you should be able to keep up with the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>"[...]The Stacks blockchain is not unique in this design choice, but it is different from the majority of chains that we see today, which is that the Stacks blockchain is an open membership blockchain, meaning anyone can choose to become a miner."<br></blockquote><p>Now, while these requirements might seem kind of high, with a 10 megabit connection, and relatively recent computer, if you compare it to a lot of other blockchains, they make this assumption that if you are running a node in the network, you\'re going to be running it in a powerful data center, like either in the cloud, or even stronger data center computer. So, because of these two design choices, there\'s a couple of impacts. One is that all blocks should be processable on one of these modest machines with a modest connection on the order of like a minute, maybe a little bit faster than that.<br></p><p>The second thing that falls out of this is that blocks should be relatively small. So, in Bitcoin\'s case, blocks are around two megabytes, and that\'s what we chose for stats as well as we have the same desired bandwidth requirements. Because of those two things, there\'s a limit on the number of transactions that can be included in a block. A block can be at most a minute and it can be, at most, two megabytes of data. Okay, so that\'s one constraint.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The second is that when Stacks 2.0 launched, we had very precise measurements of how the Stacks blockchain performed some of its database operations, but not all of the Clarity on time operations. And so at the time of launch, we took a very pessimistic view of the maximum run time of various Clarity instructions. And we said in the worst case, what this will mean is that blocks will be a little bit faster to process than we expected. Maybe blocks will be 10 seconds to process rather than a minute.<br></p><p>And later on, we\'ll be able to enable changes either through a cost voting process or a SIP proposed fork to correct those changes. But right then we were just trying to avoid the possibility that we could have like 10 minute blocks, which would prevent people from making forward progress as miners.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>So those are the two big design decisions that went into Stacks 2.0, that put us in the position we\'re in today where there\'s a lot of traction on the Stacks network, and the block limits are pretty small or pretty conservative.</strong> And so we see a backlog of transactions.<br></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Thank you. And it sounds like there\'s a fair amount of opportunity to improve things. So, you\'ve worked closely on a network upgrade proposal called <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/sips/blob/draft/sip-012/sips/sip-012/sip-012-cost-limits-network-upgrade.md">SIP-012</a>, and I\'d love to dive deeper in that. There was a <a href="https://forum.stacks.org/t/update-on-hiro-s-work-towards-network-scalability/12547">forum post</a> that was recently published on the topic. But again, this is a cost only network upgrade. Can you outline some of the key components that are included in the SIP and what those improvements are?</p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, sure. So, the SIP covers basically two topics. The first topic it covers is how the SIP itself would get activated. How do you measure support for the SIP? How would the SIP once it\'s implemented be rolled out and how would participants know? How would participants signal and all that kind of stuff? Then the second part of the SIP is really about what the actual changes in the network would be and is where all of the cost changes are.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The cost changes are broken down into a couple different categories, but at a high level, there\'s two different proposed changes. One of the proposed set of changes is saying, "Okay, we have the Stacks blockchain and a Clarity run time that we have today, but we are assessing the cost of operations in a really, really conservative way." So the question that we were asking is, "Okay, what if we were trying to lower the bounds on that cost assessment and make the cost assessment more closely match what we actually see in the performance of the implementation we have today."<br></p><p><strong>There was a lot of benchmarking work that went into this</strong>. There\'s a project called <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-benchmarking">Clarity benchmarking</a> on GitHub. You can see all of the benchmarks we ran. Basically what these benchmarks are, is you take a bunch of Clarity operations, you measure them on different devices, and you see how long they actually take to process. And then based on that, you adjust how the Clarity virtual machine in the Stacks blockchain counts costs for those operations. So, that\'s one class of changes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The other class of changes is we looked at the underlying data store used by Clarity smart contracts in the Stacks blockchain, and other parts of the Stacks blockchain. But primarily the smart contracting language uses a data store called a MARF which has a <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-004/sip-004-materialized-view.md">SIP</a> that talks about the design of that data store and how it works.<br></p><p>So we looked at the implementation of that and we said, "Are there any quick wins here where we could speed up the performance of this MARF?” And with that speed up, increase that aspect of the block limit, too. So this is different from the other work, because it\'s not only measuring what we have today, but it\'s also trying to improve on it. <strong>So, what we found is that with a relatively simple change in the implementation of the MARF we could see like three to 4X speed up in those operations, sometimes even higher.</strong> Based on that, we proposed an increase in the MARF dimensions of the block limit.<br></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Thank you. And yeah, on that topic of the order of magnitude difference that we might expect with this upgrade, what might we look forward to once it goes live?<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, so the answer depends a little bit on the smart contract in question. So for a smart contract, let\'s say the proof of transfer smart contract, the smart contract was already basically limited by its MARF operations. The number of database operations each contract call was doing, that was what was placing the limit on its methods. And this is almost like a worst case contract for speed up. And in this case you would see a 2X speed up because we\'re allowing two times more MARF operations proposing two times more MARF operations per plot. So there, you would see a 2X improvement.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Contracts like BNS, a lot of NFT contracts, a lot of these contracts use data store operations, where they have a big list of things that they store. And then they retrieve the list out of the data store. But the list that they\'re storing is actually smaller than the maximum list that they could possibly store.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The way that we assess costs is by changing the impact of that. We used to assess costs based on the maximum possible list that could have been stored. And now we assess costs more closely to the list that\'s actually being stored. Those kinds of contracts could see much larger speedups, like easily 3X, 4X, but many of the ones that have really bad or mismatched cost assessments could see like 10X or 15X or higher speed up. So it\'ll depend on the contracts, but we are going to have like a build of Clarinet that allows you to compare like if SIP-012 was implemented, what would be the number of transactions in your smart contract that could fit in a block, and you\'d be able to see the speed up between the two of them.<br></p><blockquote>"Some kinds of contracts could see much larger speedups, like easily 3X, 4X, but many of the ones that have really bad or mismatched cost assessments could see like 10X or 15X or higher speed up."</blockquote><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Awesome. Thank you. What might your advice might be for developers who are building on Stacks, both who have contracts live today, what they might expect through this change?&nbsp; And then also folks who are looking to launch in the next couple of months, what recommendations might you have?&nbsp;<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p><strong>In general, my recommendations to smart contract developers are just test, test, test. </strong>You should be absolutely testing your smart contracts, so much more than you think you need to be testing them. <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarinet-taking-clarity-development-next-level">Clarinet’s</a> a wonderful tool to do that. It\'ll also tell you what the cost of your operations is. You\'ll be able to see, "Okay, this defined public method in my smart contract", like if a Stacks block was just full of this defined public method, how many such transactions would fit in the block? You could see a number of like 900 and you could say, "Okay, that\'s like a pretty good number." Or you could see a number like 80 and you might start to worry that your transactions would turn out to be too expensive, or you might not get picked up very quickly. And you can compare these between SIP-012 and today, and see like, "Well, if SIP-012 rolls out, does this solve my cost problems?" And if it does, then maybe you wait for SIP-012 or you participate in getting SIP-012 activated, things like that.</p><blockquote>"In general, my recommendations to smart contract developers are just test, test, test."</blockquote><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Excellent. What are the next steps? I know that there\'s a bit of a tentative timeline, if you could share that. And then also any things we might look out for as this upgrade is potentially implemented that might impact, if anything.</p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah. So there\'s a couple of things happening. You can follow along in the implementation work stream. On the <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain">Stacks blockchain repository</a>, there\'s a set of issues tagged next-costs. And there\'s also a public project board for, I think it\'s labeled Stacks 2.05, but that encompasses the SIP-012 changes if they activate. So, you can follow along there, comment on the goings on, and you can see the progress of that work there. Second thing you can do is there\'s a pull request on the Stacks governance repo for SIPs. That\'s the SIP-012 poll request. There\'s a lot of comments on there. <strong>You can read it, make your own comments, participate in that discussion and also follow along in the activation signaling process.</strong> So, SIP-012 talks a lot about how Stackers and other community members can be involved in the voting process for SIP-012 getting approved.<br></p><p>So, you can look there, get involved with that and follow along the progress, or if you are a Stacker you can <a href="https://sip012.xyz/">participate</a> in the voting once the tooling for that is live.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The final part of your question was estimated timelines. I think that it\'s still a little early to give a great timeline. Based on the discussions in the Stacks core devs <a href="https://discord.gg/v9aAWABe">discord channel</a> and the <a href="https://community.stacks.org/engineering-weekly">public blockchain meetings</a>, the idea is that we\'re not going to propose a block height, which would be like the time of the activation until at least half of the issues in the 2.05 project board have been reviewed, and closed, because that\'ll give us a much better sense of how to estimate launch time. But right now the target is the end of November or around there.<br></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>All right. Awesome. Will any specific action be required for folks that are building apps through the change? Say, it\'s implemented, should people be looking out for something in particular? I understand there also might be some action that miners need to take to upgrade their software, but yeah, anything that the users might need to keep in mind?<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>The people that will have to take action, or choose to not take action are basically anyone who\'s running a Stacks blockchain node. So if it\'s part of your application, you\'re running Stacks blockchain node, and service saying API requests, you would need to upgrade that node in order to follow this 2.05 fork. If you don\'t want to follow the 2.05 fork, don\'t upgrade your node. And you\'ll be in Stacks 2.0. <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/mining">Miners</a>, same thing. All of them are running the Stacks blockchain node in order to actively mine, they would need to upgrade. So, yeah, but if you\'re just a smart contract developer, you launch your smart contract, you\'re not running a node yourself, then there\'s nothing you need to do.</p><p><strong>Also nothing about the Clarity language itself is changing. So your smart contract today could be written exactly the same as your smart contract tomorrow. It just might have different costs.</strong></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Thank you. Switching gears a little bit, another part of ongoing work on scalability is better <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/discussions/2825">fee estimation</a> toward a more robust fee market on Stacks, and the corresponding implementation in the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet">Hiro wallet</a>. I\'d love to hear more about this.&nbsp;<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, sure. So this work stream, unlike the SIP-012 work stream, doesn\'t change anything inherent about the network. It doesn\'t change the consensus rules of the network. It just adds API endpoint and suggests changes to miner behavior that improve how blocks are assembled throughout the network. To understand these changes, I think you need to first start with how miners evaluate transactions today. What\'s going on in the latest release version of the Stacks blockchain is that a naive miner will receive transactions from users from the network people propagate transactions around. And these transactions won\'t be included in a block. And so when a miner is assembling the block, the next block that they\'re trying to mine, they look at all these transactions that haven\'t been mined yet. And they come up with some way of ordering those transactions and then they try to include them in a block.<br></p><p>Once they reach the block limit, they say, "This is my block", announce it. And the block gets mined. What happens today in this ordering is basically the miner does two things. It first sorts based all of the transactions by the total fee paid by the transaction. And then it figures out based on the total fee paid by the transaction, what the total fees would be from like a given Stacks account, if all their transactions were included, and then it tries to start including transactions that way. So, there\'s a couple weird behaviors right now in like the default miner that have to do with does this account have like a high fee transaction that was included before, or might get included later such that the ordering isn\'t exactly higher fee transactions get included more quickly, but for the most part, the way it works today is transactions are just considered by miners based on the raw fee that they pay.<br></p><p>This works okay. But the problem is that not all transactions are the same, right? My transaction, for which I pay five Stacks, might be a hundred times less expensive for the miner to include in a block than someone else\'s transaction that pays 20 Stacks. But the miner will include the 20 Stacks one, because they\'re just paying more than my transaction, even though in some sense, it\'s paying more for the portion of the block that it\'s consuming.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In order to fix that situation, we have a set of changes called fee estimation. In fee estimation, basically what every node in the network is doing is, they\'re seeing transactions get processed, they come up with estimates for what portion of the block limit any given transaction is going to consume.<br></p><p>This way, when the miner is looking at the mempool, they can see not only the raw fee paid by the transaction, but also the portion of the block limit that they think this transaction is going to consume.<br></p><p>Based on those two values, they can determine an estimated fee rate so that they could see the transaction that I had that was five Stacks and only occupied one 100th of the block is actually a much more cost effective transaction to include than this other one that maybe pays a high fee, but is a hundred times more expensive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That\'s the broad set of changes. It\'s mostly focused on miner behavior, but in addition to that, we add endpoints that allow users to obtain these estimates, such that when their wallet is about to broadcast a transaction and decide what fee to pay it can get this estimate so that it knows like this is going to be an expensive transaction. I need to increase the fee, or this is a cheap transaction, and I can reduce the fee, things like that.<br></p><blockquote>"This way, when the miner is looking at the mempool, they can see not only the raw fee paid by the transaction, but also the portion of the block limit that they think this transaction is going to consume."<br></blockquote><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Very cool. Thank you. And I am just curious about how people might think long term about this fee market, and just given what we\'ve seen in other networks where things can almost become a little bit inhibitive for transactions. Anything that you would say about the fee market that\'s specific to Stacks?<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>So I guess there\'s a couple of ways in which the fee market for Stacks will be slightly different than the fee market for other blockchains, but mostly it\'ll be similar to other blockchains just because you have a block limit, everyone\'s competing to get into the block and they compete with their fee rates. During periods of high congestion in the network, you\'re going to see high fees. That\'s the way life is in a blockchain. <strong>The big difference between Clarity and a lot of other blockchains that support smart contracts is the way that the fee is assigned for transactions.</strong> So, in Clarity or in the Stacks blockchain, each transaction just pays like a single fee amount. Like your transaction says, "I\'m paying 10 Stacks." That is always the amount that your transaction will pay.<br></p><p>If that\'s not enough to get included in a block, then you\'re not included in a block. Other blockchains, like you can think of Ethereum or other blockchains that support smart contracts. The way that those work with their transaction fees is that you actually specify the maximum fee that you would ever be willing to pay. And then a fee rate such that when the transaction executes, you don\'t actually know how much transaction fee you\'re going to be paying until the transaction executes. So, there\'s a lot more uncertainty there on the user\'s end, and the model is a little bit less clear to users, and that can be a little bit more hostile.<br></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Awesome. Thank you. And so we are coming up on our time here. I feel like we could do many more episodes covering Clarity and other topics because of such a breadth and depth of knowledge here. You work a lot in public, on GitHub collaborating with folks that are maybe synonymous, or other entities. Any closing comments, or thoughts, or ways that the community can get involved that you\'d like to share?</p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah. I guess, well, the one big thing I would say is if you are excited about these sets of changes like SIP-012 in particular, go take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/pull/41">pull request on the Stacks governance org</a>, <a href="https://sip012.xyz/">participate in the vote</a>. And <strong>if you want to get more involved in Stacks blockchain stuff, hang out on our </strong><a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain"><strong>Git repo</strong></a>. Issues are read, we have discussion posts, stuff like that. And PR\'s are always welcome. Reviews could be tedious, but definitely GitHubs the place to get involved.&nbsp;<br></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Great. And just to recap, these are some of the changes that are happening over the next month, or so essentially Q4 this year. And there\'s a lot that we can look out for with this improvement in the Stacks improvement proposal SIP-012, as well as these network fee improvements happening as well. And then I think we\'re going to have to touch base about there\'s a lot of proposals for introducing additional scalability efforts to the Stacks blockchain. We can dive into that in a future episode, but thank you so much for joining Aaron.<br></p><h4>— <strong>AB:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, of course. Thank you, Gina.<br></p><h4>— <strong>GA:</strong></h4><p>Thanks everyone for tuning in!<br></p>',

        '<p>In an increasingly digital world, digital communities become more important than geographic ones, and they spread their culture more rapidly than any other has in history. Crypto communities, built with a digital-first mindset, are seeing the same success: People with a shared financial interest and a passion for seeing a change happen in the world are disseminating their ideas, values, and cultural norms in real time. <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/nft-curious-bet-on-bitcoin-nfts-to-secure-your-digital-legacy">And through NFTs</a>, crypto communities have created not only a unique distribution method, but a preferred place to store their cultural artefacts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I’m energized every day by the new creative work I see coming from the Bitcoin NFT community, and I’m eager to share what I have learned from them in this post, as well as share some of my favorites.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h1>The Bitcoin NFT Renaissance&nbsp;<br></h1><p>Bitcoin is the largest crypto community connected through a shared purpose of bringing sound money to the world.

In the past few weeks, artists and communities who love Bitcoin have started representing various stories and symbols of Bitcoin culture as NFTs. This movement is organic, like culture itself.

Your fans are far more likely to have BTC than ETH in their digital wallets, and buying NFTs backed by the power of the Bitcoin blockchain makes the decision easier.<br></p><p>Bitcoin, the fully decentralized network, is the best blockchain to support the paradigm shift of control we’re witnessing: With Bitcoin, no central owner or platform determines your distribution, and Bitcoin can provide unparalleled durability and stability for the assets you create and own.<br></p><p>Until recently, building NFTs for Bitcoin wasn’t easy, and even Rare Pepes, while innovative didn\'t have the opportunity to take off on Bitcoin (Rare Pepes have even <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/31/rare-pepe-steeped-in-bitcoin-history-fetches-500k-on-nft-market-opensea/">showed up as "wrapped" assets on other L1s</a>). <a href="http://stacks.co">Stacks</a>\' novel approach is the first to introduce Bitcoin NFTs that allow for NFT programmability through expressive smart contracts enabling royalties and on-chain marketplaces that can read, react to and settle on Bitcoin all without clogging the main Bitcoin chain.

This could be what finally turns the music industry as we know it into a sustainable industry, where everyone gets paid what they’re worth and everyone who does something useful stays in the game.”</em><br></p><p>You’ll never need to go through a lawyer to chase down a payment again with NFTs. Each time an NFT is sold, a percentage of the sale goes straight to the artist, and this process is controlled through a smart contract, not layers of handlers or excuses. Artists can also receive automatic payments on the secondary market through the smart contracts as well as fractionalizing ownership of assets. This puts power back in the hands of creatives.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With Bitcoin NFTs built with Stacks, artists can also benefit from a unique financial characteristic of Stacks’ blockchain design. Stacks can be leveraged to create a growing, ongoing annuity for a project or cause of the artist\'s choice by setting up the contract to automatically send a set percentage of transactions, in both initial auction and all secondary purchases, to a "vault" where it can <a href="https://www.stacks.co/stacking">earn a roughly 10% yield in pure BTC.</a> This mechanism is the same that MiamiCoin used to accumulate over <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/30/crypto-miamicoin/">$7 million in reserves for the city of Miami</a> in just a few weeks (as of the publication date for this post, the Miami City Wallet balance is valued at over $16 million).</p><p>‍<br></p><h1>Expanding the Metaverse with Bitcoin NFTs</h1><p>NFTs aren’t just limited to graphic art, video clips, or songs. When Kings of Leon released their album this year in the form of an NFT, they offered various kinds of tokens including one that offered front row seats at their live shows for life. And in the gaming world, the number of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/">games</a> offering NFTs as items like virtual plots of land or armor is exploding. Sky Mavis, for example, recently raised $152 million at a ~$3 billion valuation to grow <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>, which monetizes via NFTs. Sales of the NFT characters have now reached <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/06/sky-mavis-raises-152m-at-nearly-3b-valuation-for-axie-infinity-play-to-earn-nft-game/">$33 million a day</a>.<br></p><p>If you have a unique idea for your Bitcoin NFT, a developer in the Stacks ecosystem can probably help you build it.

        '<h2>Accomplishments in Q3</h2><p>Hiro accomplished the following in Q3, <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/hiros-focus-areas-for-the-third-quarter-of-2021">as previously announced as objectives</a> for that quarter:<br></p><ul><li>Made it easier to integrate Clarity smart contracts into applications</li><li>Made Clarinet extensible for contract development with new documentation</li><li>Added microblocks, Rosetta and token metadata support to the Stacks Blockchain API</li><li>Provided more resources for hosting your own API instances</li><li>Supported microblocks in the Hiro Wallet and Stacks Explorer</li><li>Improved onboarding into Stacks apps with UX enhancements and bug fixes for Hiro Wallet and Connect</li><li>Tested and streamlined documentation for first-time developers</li><li>Increased the quality and presentation of our developer communications and content</li></ul><h2>What We’re Focused On in Q4</h2><p><a href="https://forum.stacks.org/t/update-on-hiro-s-work-towards-network-scalability/12547">As we’ve posted on the Stacks forum</a>, our #1 priority not just at Hiro but across the community is addressing the developer pain caused from network congestion. One of our top priorities as a company is to create top notch developer experiences, and to do that we must first buckle down and remove this major obstacle.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is of course an ecosystem-wide effort. For Hiro’s part, we’ll be focused on the following:<br></p><ul><li>Increasing the reliability of transactions on Stacks</li><li>Reducing friction for Hiro Wallet users to get from installation to using Stacks apps, with or without a Ledger device</li><li>Improve performance and scalability of Stacks Blockchain API</li><li>Improving our understanding of Hiro product performance using a variety of metrics</li><li>Working with community and stake-holders to support the network-upgrade outlined in SIP-012</li><li>Reducing the amount of time it takes to write testing suites for Clarity smart contracts</li><li>Developing solutions for end-to-end integration tests for Clarity smart contracts</li><li>Improving the speed at which the Clarity VM is integrated with the Clarity REPL, resulting in increased development velocity on Clarinet and other consumers of the Clarity REPL</li></ul><h2>What We’re Not Focused On</h2><p>Achieving the above will take all our time, resources, and energy, which means we won’t be able to help the many community projects that are in need of support. As mentioned in <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/hiros-focus-areas-for-the-third-quarter-of-2021">last quarter’s post</a>, we will not be focused on a number of data storage, mobile, and Clarity projects, and if anyone in the community wants to work on these projects, we would welcome and support those efforts however we can.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Let us know what you think</h3><p>If you have any questions about these priorities, <a href="http://stacks.chat/">please join us on Discord</a> and ask in the <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dev-general">#dev-general</a> channel!<br></p>',

My name is Gina Abrams and today I\'m excited to be joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sungminaum/">Sungmin Aum</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.lucidefi.ai/">Lucidefi</a> and Lucidefi product <a href="https://www.stackswap.org/home">Stackswap</a>. Stackswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and token launchpad that is live on <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> today. Sungmin, I\'d love to start by hearing a bit about your background and what brought you into the Bitcoin and Crypto ecosystems.<br></p><h4><strong>— Sungmin Aum:</strong><br></h4><p>Thank you, Gina. I used to do AI research and my research interest was in program generation and black swan event detection and they are still my interests. I\'ve gotten into blockchain because I thought it would be the best place to test and develop AI driven governance as loss can be implemented in code. I think once the DEX business stabilizes, automation of governance will be one of our main R&amp;D focuses.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Fascinating. Thank you. I\'d love to hear more about all the capabilities of Stackswap.<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Besides being a DEX, we are a token launchpad on <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a>. We allow users to create tokens and list their tokens with just one transaction. So you don\'t need to be a coder to be able to list your project and publish a contract on the mainnet, which is probably very simple for a lot of developers, but there are some who are not that familiar with coding, and still would like to participate in the Stacks ecosystem. We basically lower the barrier of entrance for the larger masses.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Absolutely. On that note, this token launch pad really allows non-technical folks to quickly launch a token. I\'d love to hear a little bit more about this area of focus among the many and why this is important for network growth.<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p><a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a> is the smart contract language for the Stacks Blockchain. It\'s still not widely known despite its beauty. So if someone with no programming experience would like to quickly become part of the Stacks ecosystem, for example, someone who would like to launch a <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/">CityCoin</a> in his home, that person needs to go through a lot of pain.&nbsp;</p><p>By providing a token launch pad we’re lowering the barrier of entry into the Stacks ecosystem dramatically, which I believe is vital for mainstream adaptation for Stacks.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Excellent. Thank you. What kinds of arbitrage opportunities are you seeing for this Stacks ecosystem? What are some early anecdotes, some customer feedback that you\'re seeing?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Stacks is probably the only major blockchain with a smart contract capability that could trigger native Bitcoin transactions. This means we can really bring DeFi on the Bitcoin network and I believe that entails a whole another era for the financial system and entire world. Stackswap is going to lead such an era.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There is another thing to consider. Many are aware of how successful <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/">CityCoins</a> has been for the past couple of months if you look at <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/miamicoin">MiamiCoin</a>. When cities or other community coins are launched on Stacks, the only way for someone to acquire that CityCoin is by betting on an auction. That\'s called <a href="https://github.com/jcnelson/poxl">proof of transfer lite</a>, unless the token is listed on a centralized exchange.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Stackswap can not only make the launching process quick and painless, like I mentioned before, but also provide a spot market right away so people can have a wider variety of channels they could use to acquire the community coins. This effectively gives birth to an arbitrage opportunity right away between the spot market and pox-l (proof of transfer lite) mining, which may lead to further innovations on top of the Stackswap. </p><blockquote>"Stacks is probably the only major blockchain with a smart contract capability that could trigger native Bitcoin transactions."</blockquote><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Thank you. Now Stackswap also offers really advanced trading tools for folks across the Stacks blockchain and other chains. Can you talk a little bit more about how that came to be in and what it offers?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>So simple functionalities, such as stop loss and take profit orders, which are essential for trading, unless you can stay awake 24/7 or have an excellent AI trading on your behalf, or generally not available on DEXs. It\'s great to strictly stick to the idea of decentralization, but what is the use of it without users? Right.&nbsp;<br>So we have been working on the [Lucidefi] <a href="https://www.lucidefi.ai/">trading platform</a> that offers essential and advanced trading tools, such as market forecasts, over-indexes on various blockchains. Stackswap being our native DEX will enjoy much more direct integration with [Lucidefi] the moment we see enough trading volume.</p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Awesome. Thank you. Now we\'ve covered a lot of ground here, but I\'d love to summarize it and recap. What features do Stackswap and Lucidefi offer that really set it apart from its competitors?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Well, I say the biggest is the market forecast. The core founding members are professors and PhDs in AI. We had been fascinated by Black Swan event detection for years and had realized just recently that the DeFi market does not have something like the weather forecast, but it is in dire need of it. I can afford the risk of getting caught in the shower and getting wet without an umbrella, but I still check the weather forecast during the rainy season. But then I realized there is no market forecast I could rely on, even though I cannot afford to risk my Crypto life savings.&nbsp;</p><p>So as I mentioned briefly earlier, we\'ve been building a trading platform (<a href="https://www.lucidefi.ai/">Lucidefi</a>) around the forecast algorithms. Once the market matures just a little bit, we\'re going to bring it into Stackswap directly. You\'re just going to kind of see the weathercast, so to speak of the financial market that they\'re being exposed to. So at least you could be prepared for what might happen other than just being blindsided all the time.</p><blockquote>"I can afford the risk of getting caught in the shower and getting wet without an umbrella, but I still check the weather forecast during the rainy season. But then I realized there is no market forecast I could rely on, even though I cannot afford to risk my Crypto life savings."</blockquote><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Sounds incredibly useful. So we\'ve covered a lot of functionality for the project. Can you share a little bit more about how it works under the hood? Your experience with <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a> and maybe tools like <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/clarinet">Clarinet</a> and also the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web">Hiro Web Wallet</a>, anything along those lines?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Yeah. So the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web">Hiro Web Wallet</a> is the only thing the users would need to interact with Stackswap.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We were very grateful that [Hiro] developed <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarinet-taking-clarity-development-next-level">Clarinet</a> because it saved a ton of time developing smart contracts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You could deploy and test right away, very quickly. Among the functionality of Clarinet that I loved the most is called Clarinet Integrate, this command that you can use and it just has this amazing dashboard with all the nodes that runs, which could take many, many minutes if I were to do it myself. And it\'s just, they\'re awesome. And yeah, saves a ton of time and makes the dev process much more fun.<br></p><blockquote>"We were very grateful that [Hiro] developed Clarity because it saved a ton of time developing smart contracts."</blockquote><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Thank you. You also have an incredible team already. Can you share a bit of background on the process of building the team and the journey thus far?&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Okay. So the core founding members, we met at school as labmates almost 10 years ago. And we have all been, like I mentioned, just fascinated by this Black Swan event detection for years. It\'s just such a difficult, but essential problem to be solved, right? And we basically have the same interests, we were eating together all the time, studying together. And <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a>, our shareholder, helped us to expand our team with seasoned professionals from all over the world. But I feel like it\'s more like fate because the old and new members basically all share similar interests and value systems. We just clicked right away and it was scattered all over the world. And there\'s some of the team members that haven\'t actually physically met, thanks to COVID. But you know, we\'re in sync all the time, not just the business matters, but also the personal life too.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As I mentioned, like last year, we\'ve noticed that the DeFi market actually needs something like a weather forecast. We have seen enough evidence that our proprietary algorithm is far beyond any published results. So we have been building a trading platform around it. Then in the spring, Trevor from Stacks accelerator, suggested that we create a DEX on Stacks and we thought it would be a great fit to our existing product that we\'ve been developing because the trading platform on top of a DEX and DEX they just connect together. So we just went ahead. So it\'s been a few months.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Awesome. How was your experience in the <a href="https://stacks.ac/">Stacks accelerator</a>?&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Oh, it was excellent. We\'ve learned a lot of insider tips, especially things related to fundraising that you just cannot get from anywhere else. The Stacks foundation through the accelerator also gave us and is still giving us great support to move our business forward as quickly as possible. They’ve got a lot to do at the <a href="https://stacks.org/">Stacks Foundation</a>, right? So the Accelerator plays a role to connect us to everybody that we need to be in contact with and make those meetings happen very quickly and just effectively.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Now we\'ve talked about Stackswap is actually live on mainnet, but I\'d love to hear a little bit more about the next steps for the project and what\'s on the roadmap ahead.<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>First step is to create enough liquidity, which will probably be solved soon. Then we\'re going to integrate the advanced functionalities on both trading and DEX operation itself.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We want to be laser focused on DEX operation and launchpad before we move on to other DeFi building blocks, such as loans and other stuff. We\'re waiting for atomic swaps to mature so that we can seamlessly connect Stackswap and other DEXs on different blockchains that have repped Bitcoin and other markets to expose a user, a greater opportunity with the arbitrage market. So that\'s the near term goal.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Great. Thank you. And so a couple questions on the broader ecosystem at hand. What do you think is holding back some of the larger institutions from entering the DeFi space and how does that play into the longer term vision for Stackswap?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>I think institutional players generally show up after enough market size is created by the individual retail investors, right? So Stackswap seems to be the go-to place for the Bitcoin related DeFi. And I believe we will create a market size attractive enough for everyone, very soon considering the size of the Bitcoin market cap. The <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain">Stacks blockchain</a> plays a foundational role aligning us to get there. So yes, very simple. Individual retail investor first, then institutional market, then the market becomes competitive enough for everybody.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Absolutely. And you\'ve talked about sort of the market size of Bitcoin. Is that the main thing that drew you to build the Bitcoin ecosystem?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Yeah, I did mention it briefly earlier. There are a couple of projects in DeFi related to Bitcoin, right? I mean there\'s wrapped Bitcoin on every single major blockchain that has anything to do with DeFi. But Stacks has it by itself with this <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/proof-of-transfer">proof of transfer</a> algorithm and with direct interaction with the Bitcoin network and actually moves around Bitcoin the asset by the way it works. So it is possible for stacks to smart contract to create native Bitcoin transactions and vice versa very easily, which kind of makes it true Bitcoin DeFi.&nbsp;<br></p><p>From the interviews that we\'ve been conducting over the past year, there are still large numbers of people who were early, like Bitcoin holders. They\'re really not moving their Bitcoin asset into DeFi because they just don\'t feel comfortable. It\'s not Bitcoin, right? So this is what I think. Stacks is as close as we can get into turning Bitcoin into something that supports smart contracts. So yes, potential to be able to tap into the Bitcoin holders, that was the biggest attraction first.<br></p><blockquote>"Stacks is as close as we can get into turning Bitcoin into something that supports smart contracts."</blockquote><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Awesome. Thank you so much. Now, how can folks get involved in and follow along and support Stackswap?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>So by talking about it and using it, we are currently in the process of recruiting the initial liquidity providers. And once it\'s done within a week or two, we\'ll have a full scale launch. So come and try and help us improve Stackswap together by giving us comments via our <a href="https://t.me/Stackswap">telegram</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/r4QAsmAAgt">Discord</a> channels.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Excellent. Thank you so much for taking the time to be on #StackerChats Sungmin. Are there any closing thoughts you\'d like to share with our audience?<br></p><h4><strong>— SA:</strong><br></h4><p>Stacks is still young. So it will be a group effort to build a seamless DeFi experience. I would urge everyone in the Stacks ecosystem to actively participate and force the new era of finance together with Stackswap. Thank you.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong><br></h4><p>Terrific. It absolutely is a group effort, ecosystem effort and we\'re so excited for everything that comes next for Stackswap. Well, thank you so much for everyone tuning in. That\'s a wrap for this episode, make sure that you\'re subscribed to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xNLj2Mu7fW-BCq-vC9xKQ">Hiro YouTube</a> channel for more interviews like this. Thank you so much. ⬣<br></p>',

My name is Gina Abrams and I'm very excited to be joined by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JudeCNelson\">Jude Nelson</a> today, Stacks core developer and research scientist at the <a href=\"https://stacks.org/\">Stacks Open Internet Foundation</a>. Jude and I worked together prior to his joining the Stacks Foundation so I've been really looking forward to this conversation. We are going to start with Jude's background, dive into <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/c982e52075337ba75e00b79942164e31\">appchains</a> and learn more about his work at the Stacks Foundation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Thank you for being here, Jude. I would love to start with hearing a little bit more about your journey to actually joining the Blockstack team all the way back in 2015. What excited you about the project?<br></p><h4><strong>— Jude Nelson:</strong></h4><p>I remember back before Muneeb even got started with OneName, we worked together in the same lab in grad school. And that's about the time he got interested in trying to use blockchains to solve some difficult problems that existed at the time in social networks. Namely, how do you build a decentralized social network? And that's where OneName, the system that we called it, before it was called Blockstack came to be. He and Ryan Shea, his co-founder, were really interested in cryptocurrencies because in 2014, 2015, they were just starting to really take off.<br></p><p>OneName, the system that they had built, was a way to bind human readable usernames to Bitcoin wallets. So you would register a username, at the time it was on the Namecoin blockchain, and you could tie it to a Bitcoin address or an Ethereum address. There's a bunch of other slots you could put in. Same with social. You could put in social verifications to prove that you were who you say you were. Muneeb and I would talk about this periodically just because we knew each other already. And that started to turn into, he would invite me to come up to the OneName office in New York just to spend maybe a day, a week there.<br></p><p>At the time I was working on my thesis project which had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies at all, but I was finding myself in need of a system that did a lot of the things that OneName did. The system that I was building needed a single sign-on system, so you would have a username and it would bind your username to some credentials, some extra metadata information. But I didn't want to have that system reliant on a single administrative entity to control it, because my thesis project focused on doing things in the wide area where there's no center points of control.<br></p><p>That's what drew me ultimately to work on OneName, then called Blockstack because it solved this very particular problem I had with my thesis project.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>\"That was actually what clicked for me. You can use blockchains for things besides trying to build cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;\"<br></blockquote><p>For months prior to that revelation that I had [believed], and to be clear, I still maintain this today -- Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are victims of their own success. They're not going to replace dollars or national currencies, et cetera, just because they just don't have the bandwidth to do it.<br></p><p>Even if they did, the success story would be that they become just as heavily regulated as the SWIFT networking, which might be okay. I'm not here to judge or to say anything about the philosophy or the underlying ethos behind that. I'm looking at it purely from a distributed systems perspective.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I guess the other thing that came with that revelation that you can use blockchains for non-financial things is that it doesn't matter whether or not you believe that cryptocurrencies are going to become money or not. They're still valuable.<br></p><p><strong>The thing that really underpins the value of Bitcoin to me is the fact that I can store some data in the blockchain, specifically in something called an OP_RETURN output, within a Bitcoin transaction. It's not a lot of space. It's 80 bytes per Bitcoin transaction, but the stuff you can do with that 80 bytes is worth a hell of a lot more than what Bitcoin currently would be valued at, if this was widely known, widely understood information. In fact, we exploit this very system now to build the Stacks blockchain, all of the Stacks metadata that's needed to reconstruct the Stacks blockchain is embedded in these little 80 byte fields.</strong></p><p>So, if you think about it that way, a single Bitcoin transaction might be worth a whole Stacks block. So thousands of dollars. And that's just a single little tiny sliver of data. That could be what underpins Bitcoin's value in the long run. I don't know, but the point is though there's more to Bitcoin than just trying to replace dollars.<br></p><blockquote>\"There's more to Bitcoin than just trying to replace dollars.\"</blockquote><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Absolutely. You've now been with the project over a number of years. Can you share more of the evolution of your journey in the Stacks ecosystem and where it's brought you, what you're working on today on the day-to-day?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Sure. Back when I joined it was OneName, and the first task I had when I joined OneName officially was to port the system from Namecoin to Bitcoin. The story at the time was that Namecoin was going to be this replacement for DNS. And it still exists. The chain is still out there, but the thing that Muneeb discovered and he wrote about his PhD thesis, is that if your chain is not widely used or not nearly as popular as maybe the top few on Coinmarketcap, bad things can happen to that chain and no one's going to notice. So Muneeb noticed that Namecoin, a mergemined chain (what that means is that Bitcoin miners can submit their proof of work to the Namecoin chain and earn a Namecoin coin base as well. In theory, this makes it so that the Namecoin chain is secured by Bitcoin's hash power).</p><blockquote>\"What Muneeb discovered and reported in his PhD thesis is that merge mining doesn't work if you don't have all or nearly all of the Bitcoin miners participating in it. What he discovered is that Namecoin was actually controlled by a single Bitcoin miner at north of 60% hash power. So Namecoin was effectively 51% attacked for months and months at a time. And if that wasn't bad enough, no one noticed, no one cared.\"</blockquote><p>So, that was like a penny drops moment for all of us thinking, oh, shit, we can't rely on these smaller blockchains because they can break. And we're SOL if they break. What are we going to do? Who's going to care? Who's going to spin up miners? The conclusion we drew from that is we really should build on the strongest blockchain that if something bad happens, everyone's going to notice and everyone's going to raise hell about it. And that's the interesting social aspect of building on Bitcoin. It's the chain with the largest number of users that you can now deputize to keep the system secure. It's like the system with the largest number of canaries will start screeching and then if something bad happens. You're not going to get that with a small blockchain.<br></p><p>So that's where the journey started. Like, okay, we have to build on Bitcoin. Everything must be built on Bitcoin because it is the most secure blockchain and moreover, we need to build it in a way so that if something else gets better than Bitcoin, we can switch to that very quickly. Hard lesson learned there. And that's when the system got ported from Namecoin over to Bitcoin, that's when the name changed from OneName to Blockstack, because at the same time we had noticed that the problems you need to solve in OneName, so not only binding names to this extra off chain metadata, you also need a way to store that metadata. You need a way to store profile pictures. The amount of data you might store per name can grow unbound.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So at about the same time as we built, and we ported the system over to Bitcoin, we had this other aha moment that, oh, hey, we have </strong><a href=\"https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns\"><strong>naming</strong></a><strong>, we have </strong><a href=\"https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/guides/data-storage\"><strong>storage</strong></a><strong>, we have an underlying </strong><a href=\"https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/gaia#understand-gaia-in-the-stacks-architecture\"><strong>peer-to-peer network</strong></a><strong> that replicates that data. This is looking less and less like a single application, OneName, and more and more like a platform, like a decentralized community owned platform.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>And that's when we changed the name to Blockstack. The reason it was called Blockstack is because at the time, there was an up and coming cloud computing platform called OpenStack, which is supposedly meant to make it so that you can combine different types of one off services and turn them into a coherent cloud platform.<br></p><p>I'm not quite sure how they ended up in practice. It's pretty obscure now. I'm guessing it didn't quite work out that way, but at the time, that was the inspiration for the name Blockstack, a play on the word OpenStack. <br></p><p><strong>That’s where we were up until the Stacks 2.0 world. Blockstack became this platform on which you can build these decentralized apps where users own their own data and their own identities. And Stacks 2.0 is a continuation of that story, but now they also own the means of computing, realized in our case through </strong><a href=\"https://clarity-lang.org/\"><strong>smart contracts</strong></a><strong>. But the fundamental design networks are still the same.</strong><br></p><p>We use Bitcoin to store hashes of metadata inside of OP_RETURNS. And we have this other system that takes care of replicating state to all of the stack specific nodes. It's just that we've now reached the, \"Master design,\" as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/muneeb\">Muneeb</a> likes to call it, where you're not only storing naming and storage routing information, you're storing whole programs written in clarity that can do things beyond just simple name registrations.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>That brings us to your work at the <a href=\"https://stacks.org/\">Stacks Foundation.</a> Since you've been through this incredible evolution of the project, you've also touched a lot of the code within the ecosystem. What are some of the things that you're most focused on today?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Right before we started this chat, I was working on making the mempool synchronization better. So that transactions have a much higher chance of making it to all of the Stacks nodes and pools as opposed to 50% of them, which is about where we're at right now. That said, the primary thing that I work on right now is still the <a href=\"https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain\">Stacks blockchain</a>. Specifically, I work on the parts that aren't <a href=\"https://clarity-lang.org/\">Clarity</a>. Aaron works mainly on Clarity, for example. Aaron and most of the other <a href=\"https://www.hiro.so/\">Hiro</a> engineers interface with that. I work on the peer network, the block database, the chain state, the index over the chain state.<br>Recently, I released a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/c982e52075337ba75e00b79942164e31\">prototype system of appchains</a>, which is one of the <a href=\"https://forum.stacks.org/t/framework-for-stacks-scalability/12359?u=muneeb&s=09\">handful of scalability solutions</a> that are being considered for the Stacks blockchain. So yeah, I've touched most parts of the code base. I've worked on <a href=\"https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/gaia#understand-gaia-in-the-stacks-architecture\">Gaia</a>, I've worked on what was called blockstack.js at the time. Now it's called <a href=\"https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js\">Stacks.js</a>. I'm pretty sure some of my code is still in there. I've worked on CLI tooling for it. Wherever there's a need really is where I contribute.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Awesome. Thank you. So that brings us to this idea and concept of appchains. This is something that you've been thinking about for a few years and almost working on as a side project. I'd love to hear a little bit more about appchains and the overview that you shared recently of the concept and some of the key takeaways for developers and users alike.<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Sure. So just a bit of background.&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchains by themselves don't scale. A blockchain cannot scale, is designed not to scale. It is the perfectly unscalable distributed system. That's okay though, because what you get by giving up scalability you gain in resiliency. So the fact that everyone in the world can run a Bitcoin node right now, for example, means that if you want to stop Bitcoin or break Bitcoin, you really have to attack a sizable portion of the internet itself, which is a tall order.<br></p><blockquote>\"Blockchains by themselves don't scale. A blockchain cannot scale, is designed not to scale. It is the perfectly unscalable distributed system.\"<br></blockquote><p>And a lot of people would notice and be very upset by that, which in turn would lead to the attacker likely being stopped through some protocol external means such as elections, revolution, protests, et cetera. That's a good thing. The fact that everyone can get involved in your blockchain running a node is really what gives it its staying power. And that's an echo of the lesson learned by “you must build on Bitcoin” because that's going to have the most people who are upset when something breaks.<br></p><p>So blockchains not scaling means blockchains are highly resilient, but that doesn't mean that people are going to stop caring about scalability. Obviously, at any given point in time, there's going to be one or a handful of blockchains that are touting the “we have infinite block capacity. You should use us because we have free transactions.” And they inevitably fail when they get obscure. There's a graveyard of them. There's BigchainDB, and EOS isn't what it used to be. I think Solana is the popular one right now. Give it five years.<br></p><p>It's not that they're not trying. Their hearts are in the right place. It's just that the promise of blockchains is that anyone can run a node. And if you can't run a node, then why am I using a blockchain? There are way better ways to solve problems that blockchains solve if you can get rid of the requirement that users are expected to run nodes at home. So that's a bit of background. So blockchains by themselves cannot scale.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>But if the set of blockchains that exist right now indicate anything, it is that there can always be more blockchains. Anyone can make an Altcoin. You just fork Bitcoin, you make a few changes, you fork Ethereum and make a few changes, write your own from scratch. Knock yourself out. Making Altcoins is a relatively straightforward, permissionless way to add more aggregate transaction capacity to the entire crypto space.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Leveraging that observation there, what appchains really are, is they're just more Stacks blockchains. Every appchain is a Stacks blockchain, same protocol, same transaction format, same clarity, everything. Only difference is that what Stacks brought to the table is this novel consensus protocol called PoX, which among other things, links a blockchain to an existing blockchain by making it so that you transfer and/or destroy tokens in the existing blockchain in order to mine blocks in your new blockchain.<br></p><blockquote>\"What appchains really are, is they're just more Stacks blockchains. Every appchain is a Stacks blockchain, same protocol, same transaction format, same clarity, everything.\"</blockquote><p>That itself is what makes appchains tick. Each appchain is a PoX (<a href=\"https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/proof-of-transfer\">proof of transfer</a>) blockchain that has its own token, but it's mined by transferring or destroying tokens in an existing Stacks blockchain somewhere. So this mechanism of PoX is very generalizable. You can have the Stacks blockchain running with Bitcoin. You can have appchains, i.e., other Stacks blockchains running on top of Stacks. You can have appchains on those appchains, appchains on those appchains, and appchains on those appchains at infinitum.<br></p><p>Right now I think the prototype is capped at 2 to 32nd second power minus two possible appchains that can exist, which is about 4.1 billion. We can make that bigger down the road. We might have to make it bigger down the road. That'd be a wonderful problem to have if there are 4.1 billion appchains and we heavily need more chain identifiers. But the point is though, we're never going to run out. We can always make it so we just never run out. And through PoX, what that would mean is that all of these appchains are anchored fundamentally to Bitcoin.<br></p><p>The key innovation over having a whole set of appchains that anyone can go in and instantiate and set up much like how anyone can go and instantiate and set up an Altcoin, is that these appchains are still fundamentally secured by Bitcoin. And they come with all of these batteries included bits of technology, like the Stacks wallet would work with an appchain, the Stacks explorer would work with an appchain, et cetera, and so on and so forth. Moreover, because they're linked together through PoX, you have this really nice economics property that helps you reason about the security of individual appchains, which is super helpful for the users because when you send a transaction, you want some assurance that your transaction's going to stay on the main chain.</p><blockquote>\"The key innovation over having a whole set of appchains that anyone can go in and instantiate and set up much like how anyone can go and instantiate and set up an Altcoin, is that these appchains are still fundamentally secured by Bitcoin.\"</blockquote><p>One thing that's currently not really talked about too much, but is there, if you want to go explore it, is you can tell what the price of the Stacks token (STX) is just by looking at the chain history of Bitcoin and Stacks. So, you can look at the sequence of miners sending Bitcoin transactions to attempt to mine Stacks blocks. You can count up how many Satoshis they've spent to do that. And you can look at the number of Stacks they would've earned by winning the block race. And you can reason to yourself, oh, the expected worth of the Stacks token in terms of Bitcoin is X, just by looking at the two chains.<br></p><p>Now you can do that with the appchains as well. I can say, oh, well, I have Stackeroos, let's say is the token on my appchain. I know how many STX each stackeroo is worth based on the mining activity on the Stacks chain. And because I know how many Bitcoins a Stacks token is worth, I now know how much Stackeroos are worth in Bitcoin. I heard it said by Patrick Stanley, for example, that Bitcoin has become this measuring stick now for everything that operates on top of Bitcoin, and that would include appchains.<br></p><p><strong>So every time there is a new Bitcoin block mined, that creates a Stacks block and that in turn creates appchain blocks, which create more appchain blocks, which create more appchain blocks. And they all have tokens that are now measurable ultimately in the worth of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>So that gets us a few things. First of all, that gets us a way to reason about how economically secure each appchain is. I can reason about how much Bitcoin would have to be given up or equivalent worth of Bitcoin had to be given up in order to execute a reorg on my appchain and how deep a reorg I might want. And that in turn can inform me how many confirmations I should wait for my transaction to get mined.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If my transaction is worth X dollars, I want it to be a case that it costs more than X dollars to execute a reorg on the appchain I send it on.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The other nice thing about this property that Bitcoin drives the execution here of the Stacks chain and all of its appchains, is that it blows out of the water this idea that Bitcoin is a waste of energy. Bitcoin is not a waste of energy. It's simply underutilized. A single Bitcoin block now is responsible for triggering the creation of an unbound number of blocks in these other chains. So you can amortize now the energy spent that went into producing that Bitcoin block across all of these chains and come to the conclusion that you're actually getting a bargain.<br></p><blockquote>\"Bitcoin is not a waste of energy. It's simply underutilized.\"</blockquote><p>Sure, Bitcoin chain might take the power of a small European country nowadays, but that power budget is being applied to potentially billions of computing networks. If you consider how much energy is required to power Facebook or Google, you might actually be getting a better deal there, or even if it's approximately the same deal, you can either put some hundreds of megawatts into a data center or a fleet of data centers. Or you can put the same hundreds of megawatts into mining Bitcoin in by extension all of these other chains, you might actually be doing the same amount of work in either case.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>If anything, we're just making sure that Bitcoin is properly utilized instead of underutilized, which it's right now.</strong><br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, absolutely. And so you've shared examples with some of your work on appchains. One of them being an example of Facebook and people being able to potentially mine their own chains in a similar way that you might control who's posting on your wall or your feed. Could you walk us through this example? And also maybe if you could focus on that mental equation that you were just describing around that security versus cost trade off and how we might reason about it as someone who's either a developer or an end user and interested in how this might work.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Yeah, sure thing. So I've said in the past this crazy radical idea that your Facebook wall might be its own blockchain. Let me unpack that. Back in the day, there was this social network called <a href=\"https://diasporafoundation.org/\">Diaspora</a>. It was made as a response to the rise of Facebook and MySpace before it, where instead of having to trust a single entity withholding everybody's data, anyone can spin up their own pod that would just store their posts and that would federate with other people's pods, like your friends' pods and synchronize state that way.<br></p><p>I guess you could say the spiritual successor of Diaspora is <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a> today. It kind of operates under the same principles. Anyone can run their own instance of Mastodon. Mastodon instances can federate with each other so that you can see an aggregate view of not only your Mastodon instance, but also your federated peers instances as well. In a similar vein but a completely parallel effort is Tim Berners-Lee's notion of Solid, where everyone can host their own data in their own solid server. There's been similar approaches to that, like tent.io, sandstorm.io. Those are a bit more obscure. I think some of them might be defunct by now.<br></p><p>But the core design principle of these systems in contrast with other social media is that you're expected to run your own web server and that web server's responsible for holding your own state, your own posts, your own pictures. And there's some way by which you can view everyone's, all of your friends' photos and pictures this way.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Taken through that lens, the key insight here is that the way in which the Stacks blockchain is designed is meant to supplant the need for web servers. If you look at how today, when you write a smart contract on the Stacks blockchain, and this is a deliberate design decision, you have a list of public functions in your smart contract. Now, those are mainly meant so that other smart contracts can call into your contract and you can compose smart contracts, but the real cool case from my perspective through this lens is that those public functions are also invokable in a read only fashion through the HTTP interface of the Stacks node. So what we've done is we've made it so your smart contract is also a CGI script. So that being said, it's a small little program that if you're building a web server, it's a program the web server runs to generate a webpage. And if you're sharing a web server, back in the '90s, this is pretty common. You might have your own home directory, you might have your own CGI scripts. So if you load up your homepage, your CGI scripts run, they generate the webpage, the people actually see, and you can have dynamic content that way.</p><p>By making it so smart contracts are also serving the same role as a CGI script, we've made it so the Stacks blockchain is a lot like a shared web server. In fact, it's exactly like a shared web server, it's just that instead of being a web server running under a single administrative domain, it's a replicated web server. Everyone can run a copy of it. They all stay in sync. There's a token in place that financially incentivizes miners to add new CGI scripts and process global state changes by means of mining transactions. So what that means is that the Stacks blockchain is also the Stacks web server at the same time. They're just dual roles here.<br></p><blockquote>\"By making it so smart contracts are also serving the same role as a CGI script, we've made it so the Stacks blockchain is a lot like a shared web server. In fact, it's exactly like a shared web server, it's just that instead of being a web server running under a single administrative domain, it's a replicated web server. Everyone can run a copy of it.\"</blockquote><p>In the realm of appchains, what that means is that every appchain is also like a web server. In fact, the scalability story of appchains is a lot like the scalability story of the web itself. Just like how the web itself grew from there being one or a handful of big iron web servers that handled the bulk of a load for a company's website. Nowadays it's a cloud. You have an elastic fleet of these cheap servers that you just link together and they handle an unbound amount of request load. Similarly, appchains are like the cloudification of blockchains, in that you just add more and more of these small blockchains together in a way that the amount of transaction capacity and aggregate can grow unbound. And each of these blockchains might be small by themselves, but they serve a very narrow use case in the greater context of the set of blockchains that exist.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So with that said is if I wanted to build Diaspora today, if I wanted to build Mastodon today, it would make a lot of sense if I had, instead of a single web server to host my content, I would have a <a href=\"https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/gaia#understand-gaia-in-the-stacks-architecture\">Gaia hub</a> and a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jcnelson/c982e52075337ba75e00b79942164e31\">personal blockchain</a>, that simply maintained the state that people would see when they load it. If you want to mine blocks on my blockchain, or if you want to send transactions against my blockchain, that's still the act of sending transactions or mining the blockchain in a general sense, you spin up a node yourself, it runs a replica, you aggregate transactions people send, you mine blocks, et cetera, but now you don't have to worry about running a web server anymore.</p><p>See, the problem with trying to make everyone run web servers is that most people don't, and understandably -- why the hell would you. I don't run a server at home. It's a pain in the ass. And this is like my bread and butter. I have a PhD in computer science, I don’t run a web server because I hate it. But running a blockchain is really easy because as long as one person somewhere is running your node, you're fine. And you can't get locked into that one person running a node because you can spin up your own node at any given point in time and it will download and install and maintain a replica so that even if the person who is originally running it goes offline, your chain is still live.<br></p><p>So just like how Bitcoin has 100% uptime since it's creation because at any given point in time, there's a few thousand nodes running replicas, that would similarly be the case with any blockchain in the Stacks ecosystem as well. So you now have this fleet of web servers that are all always, always online until no one's using them. And if no one uses them, no one cares if they're offline.</p><p>So that's really like the far north star goal I have for the appchains capability solution. We fulfill the promise of these decentralized services that came before us where everybody runs their own web server, but we're no longer making you run your own web server and we're no longer requiring that web servers as an administrative point of control exist in that capacity. They exist simply as long as there exists one user who's interested in keeping them alive.<br></p><blockquote>\"We fulfill the promise of these decentralized services that came before us where everybody runs their own web server, but we're no longer making you run your own web server and we're no longer requiring that web servers as an administrative point of control exist in that capacity.\"</blockquote><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Very cool. Would the cost of mining an appchain be somewhat under the control of the person that is essentially setting it up, or what would be the factors that would go into that?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Sure. So the Stacks blockchain right now is an open membership blockchain. Anyone can mine. All it requires is sending a Bitcoin transaction. Part of the reason why the mining criteria for Stacks are really simple, in addition to the whole ethos that we want anyone to be able to mine, its open membership system, system can fork to route around problems, is also like we can't actually do anything more than that. The Bitcoin scripting language is very simple. It doesn't let you have really powerful decision making primitives on deciding who can mine and when.<br></p><p>But this is not true in Clarity. When you mine an appchain on top of the Stacks blockchain, what you're really doing is you're sending transactions and Stacks which store the same things that would've gone into Bitcoin, but you're routing them to the Stacks chain through a Clarity smart contract. And that smart contract can do things well beyond what Bitcoin script can do. So for example, if I'm running a private blockchain that just maintains my posts, I could make a mining contract that requires that only I can mine. So it wouldn't matter if anyone else sent a block commit transaction, they'd be unable to mine. The smart contract would just say, no. Thanks for the money, but no.<br></p><p>Similarly, I could say anyone can mine, but I have to sign off on it. So other people can mine, but I have to approve it, and by approving it, I allow you to have your coinbase. I can do something like, no forks are allowed. By that, I mean there's no such thing as an undo button, if you lose a block, your chain just stops. You can't make progress. I could also make it so that forks are allowed anywhere. And moreover, I can just delete a fork entirely. For example, if I wanted to nuke my social history or if I wanted to go back and edit my social history, that could be realized by having a mining contract that permits me, the owner of that contract to make changes retroactively.</p><p>So there's a huge design space here. If you can write it in Clarity, it can be done. And that would let you determine the conditions under which blocks get mined. And you can be really arbitrary about it. You can say, the first thousand blocks are, anyone can mine, but after that, it's just me, or I could do the opposite. The first thousand blocks are just me and then after that, anyone, or I could say only Elon Musk is allowed to mine my chain besides myself, or I could say, it's a free for all on Fridays, but other than that, it's just me. Whatever you want. If you can write it in Clarity, you can make it happen. You can make your mining rules happen.<br></p><blockquote>\"If you can write it in Clarity, you can make it happen. You can make your mining rules happen.\"</blockquote><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Very cool. Thank you. Could you compare some appchains to other projects' scalability solutions? I think that there's different concepts -- Cosmos has parachains,&nbsp; Avalanche has subnets, here's different sharding approaches. What might be some of the differences?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>I can't speak to the first two because I'm just not familiar with them. I think I could speak perhaps to sharding or to off-chain roll-ups, which I guess are the two most superficially similar systems. In appchains each chain has its own token and its own security budget. I think that's perhaps the biggest difference. We don't try to implement something like a two way peg, which is kind of what a side chain or a drive chain, or some types of roll-ups implement. Largely because, I guess because I see these things as web servers or decentralized web servers, it doesn't matter too much to me that there are different tokens. There actually probably should be because the token fundamentally represents a permission to write transactions to a particular chain.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So naturally, chains that are popular should have different tokens so that the people who operate those chains can realize the value that they have brought to the system by making it popular. It doesn't bother me at all. To some people that's a huge turnoff, to some people, the history of trying to do scalability systems like this, it matters a lot to these people that there's only one token and that token is manifest on both of these chains and that it's zero sum. You can't just mint more of the token. I don't care. There should be as many tokens as there needs to be. And that is the biggest contrast to off-chain roll-ups and side chains and drive chains and extension blocks, which is a Bitcoin thing that came and went. Appchains have their own tokens and that's okay.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To speak to sharding, the biggest difference between appchains and sharding, besides the multitude of tokens versus being a single token is that every sharding approach I've seen has this unfortunate property whereby if a shard breaks, suppose the nodes mining that shard all die, or the shard loses some data somehow, regardless of how that happens, it can happen. And it can be made to happen by somebody who really wants it to happen, who wants to just break the chain. It's not clear how the system recovers from that.<br></p><p>One of the promises of shard blockchain designs is that you could have a smart contract on shard A and it can do stuff, and shard B can access that smart contract and so can shard C. I can trade tokens that interact with contracts across all of these shards. And somehow it's supposed to work out. Somehow the state of shards A, B and C is supposed to stay in sync somehow. The people who build these systems, I've maybe just not seen the right documents for it, but they don't really have a good answer for what happens when shard A dies, or what happens when shard A gets reorged. If I have state on shard B and C that was dependent on shard A, does it get reverted somehow, or do we now have this causal inconsistency across the shards when a shard dies and you can't prove that the tokens that I traded on shard A, for tokens on shard B, should that trade still have gone through now that shard A is dead? It's unknown. Some approaches try to solve this by routing cross shard operations through a beacon chain or some central chain, but the problem with that is that then any cross shard operations are now bound by how fast they can go to the beacon chain, which is not very fast at all because as I mentioned earlier, blockchains can't scale. They don't scale.<br></p><p>So instead of trying to deal with that failure recovery problem, by making it so appchains have their own tokens and their own transactions, and just basically punting on this idea of there being cross appchain interactions in a seamless manner, we sidestep this problem altogether. If I have an appchain and it dies, no other appchain cares, it's fine. They're meant to come and go. Just like how, if on the web today, one web server dies, the rest of the web keeps on chugging without it and it doesn't matter. Maybe links break, but again, that's not really a show stopping problem to the web.<br></p><p>That said though, there's still space in the appchain design for things like cross appchain atomic swaps, just like there was space in blockchains today for cross chain atomic swaps. And that would be the way by which you have appchain to appchain interactions. Similarly because appchains have PoX, anything that you might do with Stacks and Bitcoin, like having custodian-less Bitcoin on Stacks, you could similarly have custodian-less Stacks on the appchain. So you might have this hierarchical integration whereby appchains can react to transactions on their host chains.<br></p><p>And similarly, the transactions that are permitted on the host chain to mine blocks are subject to prior state of the appchain just like how valid Bitcoin transactions that my Stacks blocks depend on the reward set in the Stacks chain today. So those types of hierarchical interactions are permitted in the same way that they're permitted today with Stacks and Bitcoin. But unlike the sharded designs, we don't care if appchains die, just like how Bitcoin doesn't care if Stacks dies or doesn't care that Stacks exist. Stacks doesn't care if appchains exist at all.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Thank you. And so you just mentioned an area where further development could be made. I'm curious if there are any limitations or things that folks should keep in mind when approaching appchains?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Sure. So just the web server analogy I think is still helpful here. If you have a web server yourself and you're trying to make it interact with state on someone else's web server, you're going to have to go out of your way to make that happen. There's nothing intrinsic to NGINX or Apache that makes it so that a database write will be replicated on somebody else's web server. You'd have to get the permission to do it. You'd have to set up some synchronization protocol behind the scenes. And that's all very explicit. That's something that's not the web server's problem.</p><p><strong>I think that's very similar to appchains. If you want to make a smart contract on one appchain that takes actions to smart contracts that on other appchains, you're going to have some sort of relay mechanism to make that happen. And that's honestly okay. Anything that you might use to make that happen today between blockchains, if you want to trade for example, Ethereum for Solana, you would need an exchange. There has to be some intermediary that allows that trade to manifest on both chains. And that's largely how you would make inter-appchain interactions happen as well. That said though, we do have some strategies we can employ because all appchains behave the same way. They all support clarity. So if there exists a way at all, by which two appchains can interact, then that mechanism can be applied to all the appchains in existence.&nbsp;</strong>‍</p><p>I have a write up on one way in which I think subnets might go, that might address this problem. If you think of a subnet as a super lightning channel, whereby you have a bunch of users with a bunch of tokens locked up and then interacting through an off-chain relay mechanism, whereby eventually they may want to exit and in doing so, settle their balances by leaving the subnet, you might have something like that for appchains. You might even make it so that they're inter-appchain compatible just as long as you make sure that the act of exiting this super subnet ensures that the tokens that you're exiting with are sufficiently confirmed.</p><p>You'd look at the chain security budget to figure out how many confirmations you would need and everything should be fine unless someone's really trying to break the system, in which case you signed up for that risk in the first place. You could, for example, make it so that I might have a NFT chain, like I might have a StacksPunks chain at some point. And maybe I might want to trade a StacksPunks for a StacksPop, and that can be a separate chain. Now, if I know how much these two things are worth, for example, I could set up a protocol by which I lock my NFTs on both of these chains. There's a lightning tight mechanism that allows myself and other traders to exchange them offline. And later on I might exit by making it so that a StacksPunks that I did not own, I would now own. I could submit a proof to the StacksPunks chain that proves that I now own it, thanks to this off-chain interaction I've had. And likewise for the StacksPops.</p><p>What I would just need to make sure happens is if I know how expensive it is to reorg the StacksPunks chain or reorg the StacksPops chain, I would just make sure that the amount of money that I paid for those NFTs is less than the cost it would take to attack these chains before I would be allowed to exit on chain with my new NFTs.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Cool. Thank you so much. You've mentioned this concept of 4.2 billion chains as the upper limit for appchains. Can you quantify and give us a little bit more of a mental picture around the extent to which appchains could scale transactions on Stacks and what the potential limits to transaction volume might be? I know it's in the proof of concept phase right now, but anything to keep in mind there?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Sure. So, appchains are organized hierarchically. You have this notion of a host chain in the client chain, whereby this mining contract on the host chain allows miners of the client chain to submit block commits, and in doing so, build up a block history much like how miners of the Stacks chain use Bitcoin as the host chain for Stacks. So that said the Stacks chain has finite capacity like any other blockchain. So there's an upper limit on the number of appchains, like tier 1 appchains it could support, or degree one separation appchains, I think is what I call it in the doc.<br></p><p>Let's just say for sake of argument that's 10. It's probably more than 10. It's probably more like 100, but the point is it's not that big, but that doesn't really matter at the end of the day, because each of those 10 chains, if they have the same block limit as the Stacks chain, can host 10 more chains. Let's do some math here. If there's 10 chains, then that'll give you 100 chains right there. And then after that there could be 1,000 tier three chains, 10,000 tier four chains. You can support exponentially more chains, the further degrees of separation you are from Bitcoin.<br></p><p>That said though, even in the appchains proof of concept, you can change the block size of your appchain to be different from that of Stacks. Like in the demo one that I have running right now, it's twice as big. So maybe there could be a tier two appchain that can support 1,000 tier three appchains. And that could be fine. I actually think that at the end of the day, all of the chains that are not at the highest tier, are going to be responsible mainly for hosting chains. And that's totally fine. There might even be ones that are designed specifically to make it easy to host. There can be one that has a bigger block size specifically because it's optimized for hosting.<br></p><p>So anyway, the number of degrees of separation between Bitcoin and your appchain is going to just grow logarithmically in the total number of appchains. So if there's 4.2 billion appchains, there might only be nine degrees of separation between you and Bitcoin, if you're at the periphery here. And that's something that you could build a light client for, that's something that you could make relatively straightforward and relatively painless from a compute resources standpoint to use an SPV like protocol to verify that all of the chains that link your appchain to the Bitcoin chain are in sync. And you can calculate that economic budget I mentioned earlier, how costly it would be to attack any of these chains linking your chain to the Bitcoin chain.<br></p><p>And that in turn would inform you how many confirmations you need to wait to safely transact on your appchain. And that could be done without you even needing to run nodes for all of these intermediate chains. But even for whatever reason you did need to, that's still only a logarithmic number of chains you would have to run nodes for out of the entire set of appchains that exist. And that's really where the scalability comes from. You're on the right side of the exponent here.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Thank you. As we're continuing to build on this concept of appchains and as folks play around with them more, there's just going to be a lot more excitement. Are there any things that we might look out for from the user experience perspective when considering a multi-chain world? I'm curious about your thoughts in terms of how this might play out.<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Sure. So, because each appchain also uses the Stacks chains protocols, the act of making a transaction for an appchain is no different really than making a transaction on the Stacks chain. The only thing you change is the chain ID field of the transaction, which is relatively straightforward to do. I haven't tried this on a ledger yet, but I would imagine that if a ledger app does not support sending transactions in the stack on appchains, it could be made to do so relatively easily, because again, you're just changing the chain ID. If you're building a wallet for the Stacks chain, it could easily be ported to an appchain by the same mechanism. You just make sure to use the right chain ID. I'm pretty sure a block explorer would just work unmodified because the event protocol that the Stacks node uses to propagate events to the block explorer is unchanged.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That's a feature. Appchains are meant to be as close to the behavior of the Stacks chain as possible. So if you get a developer tool or a user facing tool working on the Stacks chain, it should just work automatically with minimal modification on an appchain. That's meant to be a power multiplier. I want appchains to be very similar to the Stacks chain for this very reason.</p><p>The active instantiating and appchain is really easy. You just download and install the Stacks blockchain code base, and then there's a new command for running the Stacks node as an appchain. You write your mining contract, you deploy your mining contract. You can add custom boot code to your appchain so that you have some smart contracts that are specific to your app built in from the get go. And as long as you're running one seed node, which is something relatively straightforward to do, then you're just good to go after that.<br></p><blockquote>\"Appchains are meant to be as close to the behavior of the Stacks chain as possible. So if you get a developer tool or a user facing tool working on the Stacks chain, it should just work automatically with minimal modification on an appchain. That's meant to be a power multiplier.\"</blockquote><p>People can spin up and run their own appchain nodes that will run replicas of your appchain. I've already seen this happen for the MVP that I have. There's at least one other appchain node out there talking to my seed node that I set up. And that's really cool to see. It shows that it's really just as painless as we have thought it would be. So for user tooling, making it so that your Gaia hubs, your BNS, name resolvers, all that tooling can just work automatically with appchains, same with wallets. There will be some work required to make all of Hiro’s tooling work with appchains, but it should be pretty small.</p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Perfect. Thank you. And so what are the next steps in developing appchains? Is there a way that you'd prefer that folks give it a try or get involved?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>So like the MVP is meant to be that. It's a relatively painless way to start mining or start running a node. One thing I would love to do, if I can find the time to do it, is build a real app with an appchain, besides just having the chain running.&nbsp;<br></p><p>One concept I've been toying with is trying to build something like a subreddit on an appchain. Maybe it could be like the toy example I've shared around with a few engineers is this idea of there being a meme chain. What you would do is you could mine memes by making it so that the act of submitting a transaction is the act of attaching a meme to it, like just a URL to a meme sitting in a Gaia hub somewhere. And the act of your transaction getting picked up - and you would pay a transaction fee for this, but the act of it being picked up would give you a reward slot in the appchains PoX. So miners are mining memes and they're mining high quality memes because they want people to participate in the meming. And the people who submit the high quality memes end up getting a payout in the base token.<br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>That would be awesome. I would love to see this come to life. So we'll point people to your GitHub, to the MVP that's out there. Are there any other closing thoughts you'd like to share?<br></p><h4><strong>— JN:</strong></h4><p>Just remember blockchain don't scale. So if you ended up giving money to someone who claims blockchains can scale, I'm sorry, but you're not getting it back. You were the mark. That's okay. We've all been there. Blockchains don't scale.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>The way in which we make sure that there's enough blockchain for everyone is to make more blockchains.</strong><br></p><h4><strong>— GA:</strong></h4><p>Okay. All right. Thank you so much, Jude!

The conference exploded with excitement for crypto, and was the perfect place to make new connections, hear updates from leading projects, and maybe snag a sweet t-shirt or two.<br></p><p>Some would argue that NYC is the capital of crypto. The city has been a hotbed of blockchain startups, the catalyst of positive regulatory dialogue in the United States, and has historically hosted the most star-studded conferences that advocate decentralized fintech technologies right in the heart of the legacy financial world. it certainly felt that way strolling through Times Square passing sidewalk meetups of matching crypto swag and massive billboards from the hottest companies. It’s become a hub of innovation and crypto leadership, and, although we are a remote team, Hiro called the Big Apple home in the past. 2021 has been a massive year for decentralized networks, and it has never been a more important time to get the brightest minds together to swap learnings and share experience. Mainnet lived up to its name, and showed that paradigm-shifting crypto use cases are already here, live, and ready to change user’s everyday lives.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Crypto conferences have a special place in blockchainers hearts. Everybody walks away from them empowered in their mission, focused on solving the big problems, and excited to be a part of such a vibrant industry. Messari Mainnet was the definitive conference of the summer, and it was awesome to see a buzz around Stacks and Hiro. Muneeb was ecstatic to be back out in the community, connecting with users, and sharing the goals of our decentralized mission.<strong>‍</strong></p><h1><strong>Bitcoin in the Spotlight</strong></h1><p>Five years ago, Bitcoin innovation appeared slow and plagued by design obstacles. Fast forward to today, and it’s evident that Bitcoin is where the builders are.

Having been in the Bitcoin community since it’s earliest days, there was nobody better than Hiro CEO and Founder, Muneeb Ali, to ideate on the impact of crypto in the future. Sharing the stage with <a href="https://twitter.com/riabhutoria">Ria Bhutoria</a> of Castle Island Ventures, <a href="https://twitter.com/mosayeri">Kia Mosayeri</a> from BitGo, and <a href="https://twitter.com/_prestwich">James Preswitch</a> of cLabs, the four of them chatted about how Bitcoin has maintained its dominance for over a decade. Bitcoin’s network effect, focus on security &amp; simplicity, and maximal decentralization ensure its longevity and make BTC suitable as a global settlement layer.</p><div></div><p>Muneeb got the opportunity to share observations of a handful of interesting projects he’s seen being built on Stacks.

My name is Gina Abrams, and today I\'m excited to be joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/RuleBasedInvest">Chiente Hsu</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://alexgo.io/">ALEX</a>, the Automated Liquidity Exchange and open-source DeFi protocol. With ALEX, users can lend Bitcoin and earn fixed or variable interest, they can borrow Bitcoin without risk of liquidation, long or short Bitcoin, and much, much more. Previously Chiente has been managing director at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, she is author of Rule Based Investing, and a tenure track professor as well.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Chiente, I\'d love to start with your background and hear what inspired the shift from traditional finance into crypto, and how the idea for ALEX came to be.<br></p><h5><strong>— Chiente Hsu:</strong></h5><p>Sure. Hi, Gina, good morning from New York and good day to everybody, wherever you are. It\'s really a pleasure to be here and thank you for inviting us to this chat. So how did we come to ALEX? My co-founder and I, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-yu-alex/?originalSubdomain=hk">Rachel</a>, have been good friends for decades. We met on Wall Street and we always wanted to do some projects together.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I started at Wall Street after a three years professorship at Duke. I started at a Wall Street bank called Credit Suisse and I started building the quantitative investment business there, working with great minds. But as soon as I joined, a series of financial crises happened. It started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">LTCM</a>, the hedge fund that overleveraged. They basically got very, very cheap leverage from all the banks, but none of the banks knew about each other\'s leverage exposure, and it triggered a financial crisis. Then it was Russia that defaulted, and then you have all the series of crises happening on the financial market, spill over to Main Street as well. And so it made us think about what really went wrong, right?<br></p><p>There are a few reasons why all these financial crises happened. Of course, people can say, "Every time is different. This time is different," but really it is all about number one, information asymmetry. Often investors don\'t have information, but the risk takers have information and that\'s number one. Number two is often there\'s a centralized entity or actor that doesn\'t behave well, right? So for example, the great financial crisis you think about is a rating agency that they really, in the sense that they are supposed to work for us, raise debt properly, but they actually work with the banks and they rate debt that they shouldn\'t be rating that high.<br></p><p>It made us think, "Okay, what can we do to make this financial system much more transparent, efficient, in the sense of Pareto optimum like all the economists like to say?". We didn\'t really have the chance until <a href="https://www.stacks.co/what-is-stacks">Stacks</a> developed, Stacks 2.0 launched, that enabled us to raise <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">smart contracts</a> on Stacks, build DeFi on Bitcoin.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bitcoin is the most beautiful monetary base that I think humankind has developed. It\'s a beautiful base where we can build a financial system, but in order to build a financial system, we need to create a lot of things. We need to create bonds, CDs, and we need to create derivatives. And to create those things we need smart contracts.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I think Rachel and I have been waiting a long time for this to happen and we were very lucky that at the beginning of the year, Stacks 2.0 rolled out and we were lucky that we got invited to join the <a href="https://stacks.ac/">Accelerator Program.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>We want to build a whole decentralized, truly permissionless, trustless financial service on Bitcoin via Stacks. And I know it sounds like a lot of work, maybe a lot of jargon, but it\'s very simple, right?<strong><em>‍</em></strong></p><blockquote>"We want to have a place where people can launch the token. We want to have a place where people can exchange, and we want to have a place where people can receive leverage. That\'s really the three fundamental parts of the financial world, so that\'s what ALEX is about."<br></blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>That\'s awesome, thank you so much for the overview. I\'d love to dive a little bit further and talk a little more about your decision to build on Bitcoin versus other layer one blockchains that are out there and the decision to build on Stacks and this ecosystem. What are some of the factors that drew you to this space?<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Rachel and I are very, I would say institutionally, trending. So the first thing we looked at is what is the safest? Because I would like to say that we are not the flashiest founders out there, we might sound boring, but it\'s because we try to come up with a platform that people put their money in, right? Money management should be boring, it shouldn\'t be flashy, right? It\'s not a video game. So we searched for a place where our protocols are the safest and that is Bitcoin, number one. If you look at other chains, you have those side chains, but there are layer two chains, for us Stacks is the most secure place. That\'s number one from the technical point of view, why we want to build Bitcoin via Stacks.<br></p><p>We also met <a href="https://twitter.com/muneeb">Muneeb</a> before we joined the Accelerator Program, and I really believe in his vision. It always stuck in my head about this billboard -- instead of don\'t be evil, we just can\'t be evil, right? So I think that says a lot about Stacks and Muneeb’s vision.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Where we come from, we can offer a lot to start creating a financial world by starting to build primitives, right? If you build a foundation and primitives well, then the whole ecosystem can build something good on top of it. But if the foundation is kind of rocky, then whatever you build on top, there is a great probability later it\'s going to crumble. And that\'s what we currently are seeing in Ethereum and maybe we are going to observe in other chains as well.<br></p><p>So our mission coming to Stacks is that, "Okay, we\'re going to look at what we don\'t have in Stacks and we\'re going to start building the primitives." And as you can see, the primitives are token launchpads, the primitives are a good DEX and the primitives are, for example, those zero coupon bonds, right, that\'s really the beginning of derivatives. So that\'s where we are right now, we are building the primitives for the Stacks ecosystem.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Excellent, thank you. You\'ve mentioned that investing in ALEX is similar to investing in an index fund of the Stacks\' ecosystem. Can you elaborate on that and how you\'re working with other projects in this space?<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Sure. I know index funds are very boring, right? You are basically just a loan market. Again, I like to say, I don\'t mind if you call us boring, but we are safe. We are safe for you because we are building the foundations for you, right? So index funds are not as exciting as you hear a hedge fund making 90% this year, but index funds are safe. And why do I say that ALEX is an index fund of the Stacks ecosystem?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Number one, we are the first one where our cohort can come to launch the tokens. We want our cohort to be successful. If they are successful, ALEX is going to be successful, so that\'s number one. And number two, once our cohort launches a token, they need a good place where their tokens can be changed, so that\'s ALEX as well.<br></p><p>Furthermore, for other Stacks projects such as MiamiCoin - and we hope that there\'ll be 200 CityCoins following that (I just love this project!). People can later lend one CityCoin and borrow another CityCoin. If they prefer to vote, for example, San Francisco, instead of Miami, etcetera. </p><blockquote>"We want to create this kind of ecosystem for Stacks\' native tokens. That\'s why I say that the success of ALEX is highly dependent on the success of the whole ecosystem. We grow together. And in this crypto world, we build on the giants as well."</blockquote><p>Nothing on ALEX that can get us a Nobel Prize. But we very much depend on whoever is ahead of us, building something and we come here and we make some incremental value add, and that\'s how we grow on top of each other, and it’s the same way that we are going to grow together with our ecosystem.<br></p><p>For example, I want to shout out and not because I\'m so biased with them but just because they are the first ones to work with us, for example, SEEK and <a href="https://heylayer.com/">LAYER</a>, they are two wonderful projects, but they need DeFi, right? Instead of building their own DeFi solutions, they will use ALEX API for their DeFi part. And for example, the very exciting project, <a href="https://twitter.com/moonraygame">Moonray</a>, the beautiful game, you can play the game and then you can earn Bitcoin, right? Rodrigo will need a DeFi as well, so I would like to shout out that. Whatever you end up with Bitcoin, you can put back to ALEX, right, make your Bitcoin work. So we have to hold hands very tight and grow together. And that\'s why I say that the ALEX is an index fund, which sounds very boring, but is necessary for the whole Stacks ecosystem.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Definitely, I love that vision.<br></p><p>You have this background with the Stacks Accelerator logo, and you\'re also talking about this cohort of projects that are coming to launch in the next few months, all together. I\'d love to hear a little bit more about your experience with this Stacks Accelerator and how that\'s been, what resources you\'ve received and anything sort of surprising or that stood out in the program?</p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Oh my God, I can talk for hours about this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stacks-accelerator/">gang there</a>. Shout out to Grace, Andrea, Alex, Victoria, and <a href="https://twitter.com/to?lang=en">Trevor</a>, of course. Before we came to the Stacks Accelerator, we were a little suspicious because Rachel and I, we\'re not your typical developer co-founder. And we\'re like, "What? Are we going back to school again?", but it has been amazing. I keep on telling people, this is worse than two years at an MBA program and I know how much a two year MBA costs! From the beginning, we were basically taught how not to fail. The thesis is very simple. This Accelerator makes sure that we all minimize our probability of failure.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, what is the number one possible factor of failure for a startup -- funding, right? You don\'t have enough money. Second is the founders don\'t get along or you are not sure that your product has the market fit and you need to pivot quickly, et cetera. So it\'s really very well thought out and gives a mindset of saying, "Okay, don\'t wander too far away, do these few steps so that again, you cut off the left tail of your success distribution, probability distribution. You cut off the left tail, and then the rest depends on many, many other factors such as market sentiment and other stuff." Scientifically speaking it is very well thought out. That\'s number one, that\'s about the program itself.<br></p><p>Number two is about the people there. These five people, I just shouted out, again, I don\'t know where they live, I don\'t know their time zone! 24 hours a day, there will always be somebody there continuously checking on you, making sure you do homework, making sure you\'re not burned-out. It\'s like you have five people making sure that they want you to succeed. So that\'s just amazing. And then among the cohorts, you want to have those spillover effects. You want to make sure that everybody isn\'t in an isolated corner. They create an atmosphere, they create those channels for us to talk to each other, to work with each other.<br></p><p>In the beginning, Rachel and I were like, "What? Are we going to school again? We have laundry to take care of. We have to cook for the kids and we still have to develop ALEX and you want us to go to school?". After two months it\'s like, "How could they have come so far without the Accelerator Program?" <br></p><blockquote>"I want to use this opportunity to tell everybody that you don\'t have to be the cookie cutter founder profile right, you can be like us. We are very, very far from the kind of what people think the founder of a crypto should be, but come to join the Accelerator Program to maximize your probability of success."</blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Wonderful, thank you so much. Now, you\'ve already closed 3 million in funding, and I know that you already have a sizable team, which is incredible to see given you started building earlier this year. I\'d love to hear a little bit more about your plans for the next 6 to 12 months and what you\'re really focusing on in the future.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Sure. So yes, I\'m knocking on wood. I\'m in the kitchen so I have wood, I\'m knocking on it now. We are very, very lucky, thanks to everybody\'s help. Also, the macro environment is right. I think people understand now suddenly that if not the beginning, but we are in the early stage of an extreme, big, strong, and very pronounced macro trend, and that\'s crypto, right? This is a disruption in all aspects of society. And we are very lucky to be part of it, disrupting traditional finance. So we got lots of interest, the three million in the very beginning obviously came from the Accelerator\'s check, then family and friends, but then started really being just VCs, different VCs. There are traditional VCs, want to get early into a startup like us, a different crypto startup like us, but also they are crypto insiders.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We were very careful about how to partner with those VCs. We diversify in terms of region, we diversify in terms of the skillset, because once they are investors, they are a partner. They want us to succeed, so they will work with us. And so far, we have been very lucky that VCs have been really helping us to grow. So that\'s where we are right now in terms of just three million, and then we are going to close the seed round with a valuation. So currently we are talking to a few industry leader VCs that who actually know Stacks well to work with them, try to close this round. Once we have enough cash in the coffer, the milestone of ALEX will be Testnet at the end of September, invitation only. And then Mainnet launches, end of November. I\'m joking to all the team members that we\'re going to have cold turkey this year because Mainnet launches after November, after the thanksgiving.<br></p><p>Then the six to eight months is really laser focused on having the best product, fulfilling our promises, which we already have everything in place in the sense of the backend. Rachel is leading a fantastic team in terms of UI, UX. We want to give people the superb experience of using ALEX. So that would be the end of the year and early next year. So that\'s a plan, really these few milestones.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We are not like the one who have from A to Z every single step map out, but we have A to G map out, right? So we know those milestones, and then Z is our vision. And we would like to make sure that in every step in every milestone, we wow, we woo our investors and our partners. And I think so far, we have done that when they go into our Github, when they look at what we have developed, when they look at our UI, UX, when they look at the team, as you said, I think they are with us. They are definitely holding our hands very tight and they believe in our vision.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In terms of the team, I also want to say a few words. I\'m the one who\'s talking to you right now, I\'m the face of ALEX, but really behind this face, there is huge human capital, right? And you saw my tweet, lots of people, these guys, they like to say, "Oh, this is a bubble. That\'s a bubble." By definition, you only know it\'s a bubble after it bursts, right? So how can you call it a bubble right now? In no time, in the history of humankind, have you had a sector that grows with so much human capital, that it becomes a bubble. It just has never happened before.<br></p><p>The team is amazing behind ALEX, we have the best financial engineers. We have the best smart contract developers and an extremely senior UI, UX team. But above all, we have a team of advisors, right? They come and they help like Raoul, Martin, et cetera, and shout out to Chang as well. So that\'s how we form this partnership among us, ALEX, is that everybody believes in one dream, one vision and is a one team.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>"Although we work in different geographical areas of the world, we all believe in one vision: that we want to build the first and best one-stop DeFi on Bitcoin via Stacks. So really shout out to the team."</blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Incredible. When it comes to DeFi, a lot of early adoption has been in early experiments and other chains. And it\'s been a story that\'s been a little bit longer to take off within the Bitcoin world. I\'m curious from investors or potential users, what are any anecdotes or sort of points of interest that you might be able to share?<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><blockquote>Because of Stacks, now Bitcoin is not just a very linear kind of store of value anymore. I think the reason why Ethereum exists is because we couldn\'t write smart contracts on Bitcoin. But Stacks, it\'s like a spaceship that enables takeoff, to build a true financial DeFi on Bitcoin. And this gives us a really beautiful gateway to traditional finance.</blockquote><p>If you look at pension funds, endowments, what do they hold? They hold Bitcoin, right? Very few hold Ethereum. And not to say that Ethereum is bad or good, Ethereum for me, my very humble opinion is exciting tech, crypto projects that are happening on Ethereum. But really if you think about a store of value as money, that\'s Bitcoin.<br></p><p>Now we have smart contracts that enables us to create the whole financial world on Bitcoin. The whole gateway is open to traditional finance. And that\'s what I see, not just a point of interest, I would say it\'s a sea of interest now. If you think about being a treasurer, right, you hold Bitcoin. According to current accounting law, when it goes up, you can\'t mark up but when it goes down, you have to mark down. I don\'t want to be Tesla’s treasurer, right, with volatility like this. But then you have ALEX, if you come to ALEX it helps you to minimize your downside risk via our <a href="https://docs.alexgo.io/protocol/collateral-rebalancing-pool">collateral rebalancing</a> techniques.<br></p><p>So really again, it\'s a whole sea of possibility now open suddenly because of Stacks, we have that gateway to this traditional finance. And they\'re not just holding Bitcoin like gold, like a rock anymore. So that\'s how I see it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>People don\'t see ALEX as yet another DeFi approach similar to Ethereum. They see ALEX as something that is going to bridge the CeFi, DeFi and traditional Fi.</p><blockquote>"And I always like to say at the end of day, as a human being, as a consumer, as a market participant, really does it matter DeFi, CeFi, TFi? We want the best Fi. And we hope that with Stacks, we will have the best DeFi as a part of the service for this community."</blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Absolutely. Now, there\'s a lot of different folks who can engage with ALEX, and so I\'d be curious to hear a little bit more about who you might anticipate onboarding sort of in the very early days of ALEX\'s launch and also what you\'re looking forward to with the Testnet and if there\'s any ways for folks in the community to get involved there.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, I would love that. So if you could come to our website, <a href="https://alexgo.io/">alexgo.io</a>, to sign up and it\'s invitation only. You can please come to test out our Testnet, so that\'s number one. Testnet will be at the end of September.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Early stage, who are we catering our service too, right? I would say <a href="https://twitter.com/Stacks">Stacks communities</a>. This is your first one-stop DeFi, come to try to, for example, lend your Stacks, lend your <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/miamicoin">MiamiCoin</a>, try to borrow stablecoin, try to do something with your stablecoin or vice versa. We would like to offer banking or financial services to the Stacks community. And the next obviously is the whole Bitcoin community. We would like to onboard them and here, Stacks is really creating at the moment, developing nonstop, new functionality that ALEX will have to use, right?<br></p><p>So for example, onboarding Bitcoin, onboarding stablecoins, obviously <a href="https://arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a> is already working, we\'re very close together and also cross chain capabilities, microblocks, et cetera. We are all very, very, very excited about all this new development that we\'re going to hold hands with Stacks closely to basically develop more and more functionalities. The second stage is that we would love to engage more with the Bitcoin community, Bitcoin holders.<br></p><p>But again, ultimately the vision is to offer a true trustless, permissionless DeFi to the fiat holders. That\'s our dream. And then we can talk a little bit more in the next chat, there\'s a lot going on there because just given how the traditional financial institution, where they are going in terms of over bloated, risk control, middle office, et cetera. The traditional financial world really hasn\'t changed that much since the centuries. This is the time, right? Together, we can disrupt, but disrupt in a positive way, make it more efficient, and come up with banking services for not just banks, but also unbanked. I think again, we are in the beginning of a big movement and everybody in the Stacks community holds hands tight, we are going to make an impact.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>We\'re going to make it and make an impact! Great, well, for folks interested in this space, what might be your words of wisdom to anyone who\'s interested in building and exploring?<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>We will have our API, you can reach, for example, if you want to build trading strategy, new farming strategies, please come and have a look! You can use our protocol, use our pools to build something fantastic on it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We all build on giants, shout out to Uniswap, shout out to Aave, Compound, right? Thank you for all this fantastic innovation. We build on you, but we also bring something to the community that we have our own innovation to contribute. We have <a href="https://docs.alexgo.io/whitepaper/automated-market-making-of-alex">white papers</a>, I know some people read the <a href="https://docs.alexgo.io/whitepaper/automated-market-making-of-alex">AMM</a> one and really liked it because we generalized this. So again, come, we will help you. We build things together and we are completely open source. An audit is happening in these next two weeks. We are completely open, and you can see everything about us and our <a href="https://github.com/alexgo-io">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://docs.alexgo.io/">our docs</a>. We welcome you to come to build on us and so that we can grow exponentially together.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Great. So where should folks sort of follow along on updates for ALEX? We can definitely throw some links below, but it sounds like there\'s also going to be more exciting chats and presentations about what\'s possible with ALEX. So what\'s the best place for folks to follow along?</p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Right. So our website, the landing page, that\'s <a href="https://alexgo.io/">alexgo.io.</a> And also if you want to see our evolution, that’s <a href="https://docs.alexgo.io/">docs.alexgo.io</a>. You could also find our <a href="https://github.com/alexgo-io">Github</a> link there. We will host together with <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley">Patrick</a> some Twitter AMAs, also in China we\'re hosting some Twitter AMA as well. And we are getting a little bit more up to speed with <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgoBtc">Twitter</a>, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/alexgobtc/">LinkedIn</a>. So a lot of announcements will happen there as well.&nbsp;<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Terrific. Any other closing thoughts, Chiente? It\'s been so wonderful having you on the show and hearing about ALEX - I’m so excited!<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, I\'m happy. Yes, the thought is the following, Stacks is truly decentralized, right? We are not like other chains where someone is on top saying, "Okay, you do this, you do that, you do that."&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>"We are truly decentralized, but the human capital in this community is mind blowing. Together, we really can achieve something great. Hold hands tight, work together, build on top of each other and help each other, then I think the world looks very bright for us as a Stacks community."<br></blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Absolutely. Well, great. Thank you so much, Chiente. We\'ll have a link also to your Twitter where everyone should follow you as well and make sure that they\'re up to date on all developments, ALEX, and also wanted to give a little shout out to diamondj.btc on Twitter, who asked some amazing questions!&nbsp;<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Oh my God, wow. He even knew about the DEX already!&nbsp;<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Incredible. We\'ll continue to share updates on ALEX and we\'ll continue to amplify the news and folks should look out and sign up for ALEX Testnet participation, which will be coming at the end of September. Thanks everyone for tuning in. Please subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xNLj2Mu7fW-BCq-vC9xKQ">Hiro YouTube channel</a> for more updates like this. Thank you so much!<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— CH:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Thank you, Gina. Thank you, everybody. Bye.<br></p>',

      "post-body":
        '<p>As part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/hiro-backstage-infrastructure-series-introduction">Infrastructure Series</a>, this post is intended to provide some context to the posts yet to come. It may help explain why we’ve made certain decisions for our infrastructure to those new to this space, while re-aligning some of Hiro’s priorities with infra-veterans. After reading this post, you’ll have a better understanding why infrastructure is important to us, why we think it should be important to everyone hosting software, and some hard lessons we’ve learned — <em>or had to watch others learn</em> — in the past.</p><p>‍</p><h1>¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Why Should I Care?</h1><p>Since its launch in January, the public services Hiro hosts for the Stacks ecosystem are already being used by tens of thousands of users around the world to do things like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stacks.co/developers">develop dapps</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stacks.co/stacking">stack STX</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet">deploy Clarity smart contracts</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/running-mainnet-node">bootstrap stacks-nodes</a>, serve the <a target="_blank" href="https://explorer.stacks.co/?chain=mainnet">explorer</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-wallet/">desktop</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-wallet-web">web</a> wallets, and so much more. It’s important that these open-source services, regardless of who hosts them, are backed by infrastructure designed to scale and keep the metaphorical ship sailing at full speed ahead even when the digital waves are choppy. Let me explain why.<br></p><p>As software developers and engineers, it’s <em>usually</em> counterintuitive to spend heaps of time and stacks of money on a project to ultimately have it crash, get hacked, or provide a frustratingly slow experience (unless you <em>like </em>watching the world burn 🔥)</p><blockquote>Good design principles for infrastructure is a skill learned over time just like it is for programming, albeit sometimes with more hindsight involved. And the further down the rabbit hole you go with shaky infrastructure, the harder it’ll be to dig yourself out as traffic grows and people start depending more on your public Stacks API, where any downtime will be amplified amongst your users.</blockquote><p>It pays dividends to use industry best practices early-on, avoiding the need for potentially months of rework and calls in the middle of the night. To ensure a service is given the opportunity to reach its maximum potential and usefulness, one should strive for well thought-out infrastructure, ideally before said service is live. When done right, an efficient yet effective design will end up saving you time and money, while enabling your public nodes or Stacks services to work their magic.</p><p>‍</p><h1>🕳️ Common Pitfalls</h1><p>That being said, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for everyone; some may not have the same options compared to others due to constraints like time, money, or resources. Running Stacks services in the cloud won’t be for everyone, some may prefer physical, bare-metal servers. It’s important to understand some common pitfalls to avoid analysis paralysis and effectively cater to your specific needs.<br></p><h2>Don’t over-engineer a solution to a simple problem</h2><p>It’s easy to succumb to scope-creep and lose track of what’s actually needed when addressing slow performance of a Stacks node, high latency for the explorer, or scaling challenges for the API. While it’s undoubtedly cool to watch your services scale up to 5000 instances and fail-over to 10 different regions at the push of a button or in response to an event, the cost vs benefit tends to wane and use cases get more specific as solution complexity rises. Be sure to understand the end-goal version of a solution you’d like to implement and break it out into smaller consumable pieces before starting on it.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6144ced55d34a3edd4b7bf1b_08x-wQlG.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Rube Goldberg machines are fun, but what they <em>don’t</em> tell you is the number of countless nights that one engineer spent awake at 2AM trying to make it work. Or even worse, the frustration caused to the other engineers that need to support it when the creator left and didn’t write enough (or any) documentation!</figcaption></figure><h2>Giving a service more resources isn’t always the answer</h2><p>Especially today where many apps are designed as microservices instead of monolithic beasts of Ye Olde Tymes, you can’t always just scale <em>up</em> a VM, giving it more memory or processing power, &nbsp;and expect a better result in return. Scaling <em>out</em> by adding more running instances of that app is often more effective for many modern services like the Stacks node, and should be considered just as equally as scaling <em>up</em> depending on the metrics of your deployment.<br></p><h2>Convention over configuration</h2><p>If the defaults are appropriate for your use-case and expectations, use them! While it\'s nice to be able to call it your own, if you plan on running or hosting Stacks services, it can quickly turn a simple deployment complex by over-customizing your infrastructure and services beyond what\'s necessary.<br></p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain">stacks-blockchain</a> software has some <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain/tree/master/testnet/stacks-node/conf">example config files</a> for launching a stacks-node, where many options are set to sensible defaults for the majority of users. Similarly with the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-api">stacks-blockchain-api</a>, there are plenty of options than can be set via environment variables. However, if you aren\'t exposing it to the public and don\'t expect high traffic, you probably <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-api/blob/master/.proxy-cache-control.json">don\'t need to configure caching for it</a>. We suggest first understanding if these default settings will work for you before deciding to add customizations.<br></p><h2>Don\'t become another statistic of cyber attacks</h2><p>It\'s easy to overlook security. Implementing security measures for services deployed often becomes an afterthought for many as it requires deliberate action and consideration. Ranging from network firewalls, authentication, authorization, and generally expecting the unexpected, there\'s plenty of different aspects to consider.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6144ceffcec171698998165a_0u7UQoSR.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Nobody expects port 22 to be open, but alas, it is.</figcaption></figure><p>Making time for these considerations when deploying your own Stacks services is important and necessary. Leaving extraneous ports exposed to the public for any service is an open invitation to armies of bot crawlers and bad actors on the internet to poke for holes, try to take your service down, or look for a way in. At Hiro, we find these kind of attempts occurring every day at some level. If not adequately protected, this could expose sensitive configurations of your environment, cause excess downtime, risk sharing personal details, or worse, make everyone laugh at you. And you don\'t want to be laughed at, probably.<br></p><p>We\'ll be sure to point out areas requiring extra attention to these security details in upcoming posts.</p><h2>Throwing more money on the fire won’t always put it out</h2><p>When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The same goes for high budget ceilings, but sometimes it doesn’t matter how much money you throw at a problem. While improving security, resilience, and availability will help with a majority of the challenges you may face running your own public Stacks software, novel edge-cases are being found every month as new features and smart-contracts are deployed. Sometimes the best solution to an infrastructure problem doesn’t reside in its configuration at all, but rather expanding the service’s capabilities to handle new problem paths differently.<br></p><p><em>If you encounter such unexpected errors or bugs in any Stacks software, feel free to ask the </em><a target="_blank" href="https://community.stacks.org/"><em>Discord community</em></a><em> for help, leave a post in the </em><a target="_blank" href="https://forum.stacks.org/"><em>Stacks forum</em></a><em>, </em><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack"><em>submit an issue in the appropriate repository</em></a><em> — or better yet, a pull request!</em></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1079px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1079px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61001f37d9b8a89b4411a7bd_Asset%2028.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Albeit only a fragment, it\'s not possible to encapsulate all of the context and forethought that goes into designing infrastructure and the challenges of hosting services publicly in a single post. However, the content above should help explain for future posts why we\'ve made certain decisions for our infrastructure, improvements we\'re working on, and why you may (or may not) want to do the same. While it may only be a snippet of what you\'ll discover on your own, we\'ll be sure to cover more specific scenarios we\'ve experienced first-hand in the following posts of this Infrastructure Series.<br></p><p>In the next post, we\'ll be getting more technical on how we\'ve designed the infrastructure which runs the public Stacks software at Hiro! We\'ll be covering topics on cloud providers, auto-scaling, networking, Gaia storage, security, infrastructure automation, and more.</p>',

My name is Gina Abrams, and today I\'m thrilled to be joined by Mohammed Roshan, Co-Founder, and CEO of GoSats. Thank you so much for being here, Roshan!&nbsp;<br></p><h5><strong>— Mohammed Roshan:</strong></h5><p>Thanks so much Gina, I\'m super excited to be on your show.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Excellent! Well, let\'s dive in. You are an early Bitcoiner - how did you get into crypto and how has it led to building GoSats?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>I think Bitcoin kind of consumed me back in 2014. Since I come from a tech background I was somewhat amazed to see this gold looking coin photograph in a newspaper in India. One morning I was just like taking up the newspaper, I\'m like, "Oh, what is this? It sounds very intriguing." And after a little bit of Googling and checking out the GitHub source code, I was like, "Oh wow, this is something, are people actually trying to create money without some sort of a bank or a government, is this even possible?"<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>After digging deeper into it, it led me to the economic side of things.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>"Then I figured out Bitcoin is something amazing. It\'s something revolutionary. I\'m an electronics engineer and I was involved in e-commerce, and I just left everything that I was doing. I knew I needed to focus all my time and effort on studying this thing and understanding what it\'s capable of. That led me down this rabbit hole and I started building applications on top of Bitcoin."</blockquote><p>I was very much thrilled with the technology side of things. I used to build smart contracts, even back in the day before Ethereum. I was using <a href="https://counterparty.io/">Counterparty</a>, which was a protocol for building contracts on Bitcoin. I was just playing around with all that and I got very intrigued and I ended up joining as the CTO of <a href="https://www.unocoin.com/in">Unocoin</a>, which was the first Bitcoin exchange out of India and seeing all that and being part of the ecosystem, I saw the ecosystem kind of grow from pretty much nothing.</p><p>India was kind of late to the crypto space, but to see the way that it\'s evolved over all these years, it\'s just amazing. I worked with a couple of the top exchanges in India and I always felt like India is a great country, it\'s a great market for startups, for tech. The adoption of crypto has still been a little slow. And I always felt like people want things that are extremely easy.</p><p>Crypto is poised in this very complicated manner and a very speculative asset, there’s a lot of risk associated with it, a lot of scams associated with it. Of course, I love Bitcoin a lot, having passion about it. And I was like, how can I solve this kind of problem? How can I make crypto growth explode in India? And that\'s when I started reading a lot about all this. And then I came across what is India good at? And India is actually one of the largest growing e-commerce markets. And I was like, wow, this is a great way. And of course I’m building <a href="https://gosats.io/">GoSats</a> now.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>"A lot of mainstream audiences are on these e-commerce websites and all the different brands that are picking up in India. I thought why not target the mainstream route for getting Bitcoin adoption?"<br></blockquote><p>Because right now to get Bitcoin people have to go into an exchange and do lots of stuff and then acquire Bitcoin. I was like, why not just give it as some sort of a reward, as a cashback mechanism so that they can get Bitcoin even if they don\'t like it, if they feel the money might go to waste or whatever, they can get some good exposure to this because it\'s free.</p><p>After exploring this path as well doing a lot of research, this is a great thing to get into the country. And I, in fact, sent an email list, "Hey guys, I\'m launching so-and-so thing. This Bitcoin rewards application. Are you guys interested?" I got 500 signups on the first day. That was a decent kind of confidence that, okay, I can probably put some time into building this product and then set up a team. We started talking about it and we got a lot of coverage for this. One of the important things was that before us people thought that crypto just meant exchanges and tokens. Like these are the only two businesses that can be built on crypto, nothing else.<br></p><p>Then we are like this is so... it\'s just a new industry that\'s in making. And we’re showing that Bitcoin is beyond exchanges. It\'s beyond just being a blockchain token. We actually are bringing real-life value to customers. And that\'s when we started getting all this on. We launched this year, earlier this year and it\'s been doing great so far. A little long answer to a question, but yeah.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>That\'s amazing. Well, let\'s dive into it a little bit deeper. And what is sort of the brief description of GoSats? I\'d also love to dive into how it works under the hood?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p><a href="https://gosats.io/">GoSats</a> is a Bitcoin rewards application. People shop and they get Bitcoin as rewards and cash back. We basically tie-in with all these different brands, all the top brands in India — Amazon, Uber, Flipkart. People shop with these brands through our application and we just notify them of Bitcoin cashback and rewards.</p><blockquote>"We are also rolling out our Bitcoin rewards debit card, a prepaid debit card that users can swipe across any point of sale device in India. And they get Bitcoin back with every single purchase."</blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>It seems like your team has been incredibly busy over the last few months. You have over 15,000 early customers and 120 partner brands. I\'d love to hear a little bit more about your team and some recent developments and what you\'re excited for on the horizon.<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p><a href="https://gosats.io/team">Roshni and I are co-founders</a>, we are actually siblings, we\'ve done a lot of crypto projects together. It was good to get my sister on there — this is amazing, let\'s just build stuff.&nbsp;<strong>We\'ve been growing a lot lately. We are a team of six right now and we definitely want to expand and get the best people to work on this new trajectory to Bitcoin.</strong><br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Excellent. And what are you using the Stacks blockchain and Hiro developer tools for in building GoSats?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>After being part of the <a href="https://stacks.ac/">Stacks Accelerator</a> is when we came across a lot of tools, like <a href="https://www.hiro.so/">Hiro</a> was one of the things like getting our names registered as well, which was pretty amazing. We have plans for using the <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks blockchain</a> for giving out yield in Bitcoin through the Clarity Language and Stacks smart contract, <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fcf9ac604d37418aa70a5ab/60072dbb32d416d6b3806935_5f1596b12bcc0800f3dcadcd_pox.pdf">Proof-of-Transfer</a>.<br></p><p>That is still in development, but I\'m a huge fan. I\'ve built smart contracts for many years, and I\'m a huge fan of the Clarity non-Turing complete language. Because when we were thinking about setting foot into DeFi and giving out yield for our customers, we\'ve already noted it has to be something related to Bitcoin or a smart contract on Bitcoin. And we actually looked at a lot of different other methodologies to build something like this.<br></p><p>Then after getting into the Accelerator and we met some <a href="https://stacks.ac/teams">amazing startups</a> from the Accelerator as well, that were able to help us to figure out how exactly we can go about this. And even the partners in the Accelerator as well were super helpful to kind of help us guide through this entire process and we\'re like, "This is amazing."<br></p><blockquote>"I\'m a newbie when it comes to Clarity, but to understand how it works and the programming as well, it\'s been super helpful. We\'re definitely looking forward to providing all the different yield generations using these smart contracts under the hood."<br></blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Awesome. Thank you. I\'d love to hear a little bit more about the Stacks Accelerator — how has that experience been and what might be your recommendations for anyone who\'s interested in maybe building on Bitcoin, building in this space?&nbsp;<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p><strong>Don\'t think twice, </strong><a href="https://stacks.ac/"><strong>just apply</strong></a><strong> to the Stacks Accelerator. I think that\'s the best, because honestly when I was coming to Accelerator, I didn\'t know what to expect. I thought it\'s going to be related to a lot of technology. But the first week itself was brilliant where they actually made us go through the steps of product building and analyzing the lean startup method, which a lot of accelerators do not teach you.</strong></p><p>I\'ve Googled a lot, I\'ve researched a lot of accelerators and in fact, I was even part of one of the accelerators with the company I was associated with previously. And it was nothing like that. They go step by step in preparing you to get to product-market fit. That has been a huge game-changer experience for us and the network that these partners have provided.<br></p><p>The Stacks Accelerator offers some amazing mentors, a lot of great investors as well, and it even helped us close our investment round. We had a sneak peek demo there and we got some amazing investors that we wouldn\'t have met otherwise. That has been a great experience. I would recommend it — in fact, I want to get some of my friends to sign up for the next batch of this event if they\'re starting a startup.<br></p><blockquote>"I\'d recommend the Stacks Accelerator, and it\'s Bitcoin friendly. That was one of the major criteria, people have been contacting us from very different accelerators. "Hey, we have this amazing new blockchain token and you can build on it and we\'ll give you some funds," and all that stuff. But this was amazing because it\'s Bitcoin native and it sticks to the values that we want to provide as a company."</blockquote><p>And we now know so much about smart contracts for Bitcoin which we wouldn\'t have known otherwise. So yeah, I highly recommend the accelerator to a lot of different startups that are focusing on Bitcoin.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Great. Thank you. You mentioned having just raised some funding, what are you sort of planning for in terms of the next few quarters?&nbsp;<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>We closed a 700K seed round. Our primary focus right now is getting the GoSats credit card out to the public, to as many people as we can. We want to scale this product really well, because we\'re entering the FinTech space. A crypto company entering the financial race - it’s a really exciting moment for all of us in India. And yeah, I basically want to get this card out to as many people and get adoption for our product for the next few months.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>All right. Very exciting. I believe you\'ve talked about how Bitcoin and GoSats can together drive adoption of Bitcoin and reduce income inequality in India. I was curious to hear a little bit more about that and your perspective in terms of the benefits you\'re providing to users.<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely. When we give you the Bitcoin as rewards we are enabling any average shopper or any sort of consumer to become an investor, a passive investor. After seeing the crypto space for such a long while, I\'ve noticed a lot of people falling into certain price events and people look at Bitcoin as some sort of a get rich quick scheme, and that never leads to wealth. It might lead to making rich for a short period of time but it never leads to wealth.<br></p><blockquote>"We want to encourage wealth accumulation for users. And we feel that Bitcoin is a great fit because I mean, even the protocol, the way it has been built, it\'s very fair. Bitcoin, it is the fairest blockchain protocol that has ever been built. When a lot of more people start accumulating Bitcoin, it makes them sovereign individuals. And that is what I feel reduces the inequality in income from other places and all those sorts of things."<br></blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Great. Thank you. One thing you mentioned was having been in the crypto space in India, sort of since the beginning, how has it been building companies through sort of changing regulations and what are you seeing in terms of early adoption?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>Yeah, the regulations it\'s a very tricky slope, but I\'d say it\'s been improving a lot over the course of years. And I know that the entire world of technical space is looking at India for regulations because it\'s a huge market and all of us are working really hard towards it. And one thing that I know for sure is that there are a lot of crypto enthusiasts in India, they\'re talking to officials and making sure that the right decisions are made.<br></p><p>I\'m a very optimistic person and I definitely feel that something really great will come out soon. And once that happens, I think India is going to be a huge force in the blockchain space.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>I know you\'re focused on India currently and today. Are you looking to potentially expand internationally in the future?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely. India is of course at the starting market, but I think we\'ve built a scalable product that a lot of different geographies can benefit out of. Asia Pacific is a region that I think we are targeting. I hope we don\'t start getting competition after I said this but we definitely have eyes on a larger adoption.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Right. Well, thank you. One of the other things that you\'ve mentioned before is predicting that only 10 to 20% of the market will buy crypto. How can Bitcoin rewards sort of drive that larger crypto mass adoption?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>That\'s a really interesting question. And there was something that I was analyzing very recently. And I mean if you look at it, right, people try relating crypto to stocks, how it is being traded, but it\'s actually a completely different landscape. And there aren\'t many stock traders in the world because when people have to buy something, it\'s always a minimal amount.<br></p><p>The majority of the crypto space, let\'s say we get a billion people into crypto. A billion people aren\'t going to buy Bitcoin and crypto, no, like I said, probably just 10 to 20% of them would actually buy it and the rest of the ecosystem would get it from other means. And that\'s how you increase adoption. If the friction is payment is investment, your adoption will be a lot less because it\'s an investment at the end of the day, right?<br></p><p>People have to think a lot, especially in emerging markets, they really think a lot before investing in risky assets. And that\'s where I feel rewards are a way that we can definitely explode growth. Once people see that, oh, this is an amazing ecosystem that has a great bunch of people in the industry. Then they\'ll be convinced to put some more money into it and actually start holding a significant amount of crypto.<br></p><p>I really believe that the rewards and other sorts of gamification and rewarding mechanics would drive a lot of adoption of crypto.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Are there any sort of obstacles that you see for Bitcoin becoming the default value system of the world?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>I think Bitcoin is already there to a certain extent.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Bitcoin has won, I would say it\'s just how much more it can win. Right? That is the question. But yeah, I mean, if it is competition with other protocols, I don\'t see it really happening. Because when people talk about first-mover advantages, they see other protocols that are much more technologically heavy and smarter and all that. But people are forgetting that Bitcoin is not competing with any of that.<br></p><p>When it comes to money, when it comes to finance, people do not like a lot of changes. People like things to be secure and safe. And when something occupies a market you\'re in the first-mover advantage, it has to fail miserably for something to overtake it. It\'s not like a social network where, oh, the first movers didn\'t work or the search engines, something else came up and became better.<br></p><p>I don\'t think that can happen in finance.<br></p><blockquote>Things have to be slow and steady when it comes to finance and it has to be secure and has to be built for decades. And I think Bitcoin functions best in that way.<br></blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely. You\'re building this company to sort of drive mass adoption. What other businesses would you love to see created? If there\'s other founders out there that are looking for inspiration, are there any ideas that you\'ve been thinking about that you\'d love to see in the world?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>I\'m kind of drawn to NFTs in a way and I mean, ever since CryptoKitties, but yeah, I mean right now to see all these different, new things. For me, it\'s just exciting, <a href="https://lightning.engineering/">Lightning</a> is one of the biggest applications that I see, which can actually drive a lot of mainstream Bitcoin adoption.<br></p><p>There are a few Lightning apps coming up. Not much in India not much. I doubt there are any, I think there\'s just one or two Indian based companies building on Lightning network, but I definitely feel a lot of these more will come up and even with <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> right now, a lot of people start including Stacks because when it comes to India, India is extremely tech-savvy and that\'s the reason why Ethereum and even Solana right now is getting a lot of adoption. Because people love to code stuff and these protocols are quite a lot of amazing developers.<br></p><p><strong>I really feel that a lot of more developers that can focus on </strong><a href="https://lightning.engineering/"><strong>Lightning</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://www.stacks.co/"><strong>Stacks</strong></a><strong> and actually start building things on a much more secure Bitcoin blockchain. It’s early stages, but I\'m pretty excited to see some great stuff coming out of India.</strong><br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Definitely and in terms of sort of your future plans you\'ve mentioned, you\'re planning to leverage Stacks and potentially offering sort of yield. Are there any sort of unique business models or any unique components of the DeFi landscape that folks should be looking out for or excited for when it comes to building crypto businesses?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>Yeah. Yield generation was something that we didn\'t think of in the beginning, but is a use case for our existing product, because that\'s what our customers want. Right? And one of the other aspects that we\'ve been looking at for a while as well is to provide crypto-backed bank loans because once we understand this market and we want to do this in a decentralized manner.<br></p><p>There are companies doing it in a centralized manner, but we feel that we can actually make use of <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> to also build a <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/overview">contract</a> where we start giving out crypto-backed Bitcoin of Stacks back at fiat loans, which I feel is really exciting and would work for a lot of people in the community.<br></p><p>I personally as well, would never want to sell my crypto or Bitcoin to pay for stuff or get something. I\'d rather just lock it up and then pay whatever I have to clear it back and get back my crypto, which I feel a lot of people would prefer.<br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Definitely. How should folks get involved and follow the development of <a href="https://gosats.io/">GoSats</a>? I believe the card is about to be released soon. What\'s the timeline? Where can folks sign up if they\'re interested?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>Yeah. People in India that are watching this, log on to <a href="https://gosats.io/">GoSats.io</a> and download the app.&nbsp;You can follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/gosatsapp">@gosatsapp </a>and be given a lot of freebies, a lot of sats [satoshis] to be stacked. And yeah, there\'s a ratio for the GoSats credit card wait list. <strong>We will only be releasing 5,000 GoSats cards in the first batch, and we are almost done. So join and get your card registered. That\'d be really awesome.</strong><br></p><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>That\'s super exciting. Thank you so much for your time Roshan. Are there any closing thoughts you\'d like to share with our audience?<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>It\'s great stuff being with Stacks as well and seeing this ecosystem growing. Stacks 2.0&nbsp; experimenting with it, it\'s been super fun and Bitcoin looks a lot more stronger right now.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>With Lightning and Stacks, Bitcoin has become a lot stronger than what it was a few years ago. The future looks great for Bitcoin.<br></blockquote><h5>‍<strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Excellent. Thank you so much for being on the show and sharing your story. And we\'re so excited to continue looking out for updates and sharing them as well.<br></p><h5><strong>— MR:</strong></h5><p>Thank you! </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1079px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1079px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61001f37d9b8a89b4411a7bd_Asset%2028.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xNLj2Mu7fW-BCq-vC9xKQ"><strong>Hiro Youtube Channel</strong></a><strong> to watch new weekly Stacker Chats!</strong></p>',

        '<p>Like many members of the Stacks ecosystem, we watched with great excitement as the first <a href="https://stacks.ac/teams">Stacks Accelerator cohort</a> graduated last week at demo day. During the event, we got to meet 25 companies who revealed the results of a three-month intensive sprint. The startups represent a wide range of use cases from DeFi and NFTs to supply chain management, recruiting, P2P communication, and more. We are thrilled for the Stacks Accelerator and its team including Trevor, Alex, Grace, Andrea and all the advisors and mentors: The early success of such an ambitious program is impressive!</p>',

        '<p><em>You can watch replays of both Demo Days on the Stacks Youtube channel:</em></p><h4><a href="https://youtu.be/OjrGXcsehr4" target="_blank">Day 1: DeFi &amp; Fintech</a></h4><h4><a href="https://youtu.be/YY5QIYzJwPs" target="_blank">Day 2: NFTs &amp; Web 3.0</a></h4><p>As important as demo day is to the individual teams, we think it’s also a milestone event for the entire Stacks community — seeing the launch of a fleet of powerful new decentralized applications built on Bitcoin through Stacks is tangible proof of the ecosystem’s health and growth potential.<br></p><p>Since watching demo day and the community’s reaction, we’ve been mulling over four takeaways:<br></p><ul><li>Investors are flocking to the Stacks ecosystem.</li><li>The number and variety of developers building on Stacks is rapidly increasing.</li><li>Developers choose Stacks, because developers choose Bitcoin.</li><li>Hiro’s developer tools are being leveraged to ensure confidence when building a decentralized project.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Investment in the Stacks Ecosystem Grows</h2><p>A significant number of companies at demo day said they had 50-100% of their rounds subscribed; the idea of building on Bitcoin through Stacks seems to be resonating with seed stage investors. That’s not to mention all the traction they’ll see in the coming weeks: There were 300+ people in the demo day audience, and we recognized several seed stage funds and angel investors. Investors understand this is an opportunity to be an early adopter in a flourishing ecosystem, and believe in the incredible potential of having decentralized applications anchored to the security of Bitcoin. The blockchain industry is still nascent, and the time to deploy capital is now.<br></p><h2>Builders Want to Build on Stacks</h2><p>It’s been only nine months since mainnet launched, and before then, fully expressive smart contracts were not possible. And yet in such a short time period, we’ve seen an eruption of developer activity, demo day being one more proof point. Passionate developers are launching powerful applications, and an audience of hungry users is ready to try it out. Like we saw from the Accelerator startups, the most experienced Stacks developers are collaborating, mentoring newcomers, and sharing resources to enrich the community. Everyday the ecosystem is solving interesting engineering challenges, and it’s resulted in technical achievements like <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-009/sip-009-nft-standard.md"> token standards</a>,<a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/microblocks-reduce-transaction-processing-times"> microblock streams</a>, and <a href="https://metatroll.xyz/"> analytic dashboards</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Developers Choose Stacks Because Developers Choose Bitcoin</h2><p>Throughout demo day, teams emphasized the Stacks’ unique connection to the Bitcoin main chain as a core reason why they’re betting on the Stacks ecosystem. Stacks’ use of proof of transfer to extend security capabilities make it a trusted network to host an application. Not only does Stacks significantly reduce attack vectors by using Bitcoin in consensus, but it also gains unprecedented purview into Bitcoin’s transaction history. This allows for some novel interaction between the two chains, and unlocks the world of Bitcoin DeFi. This is a big part of the reason why Hiro has bet on Stacks.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hiro’s Developer Tools Provide a Competitive Advantage</h2><p>We learned that a significant number of demo day startups are <a href="http://hiro.so/customers">using Hiro’s developer tools</a> to ensure confidence when building a decentralized project. Throughout the three-month program, these companies used Hiro products to speed up coding, streamline transaction processing, enable authentication, query blockchain history, and a host of other crypto superpowers.<a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarinet-taking-clarity-development-next-level">&nbsp;</a></p><h2>Ready to Build Your Own Stacks Project?&nbsp;</h2><p>Excited about the potential of the Stacks ecosystem? You can start building today with Hiro’s developer tools:</p><p><a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarinet-taking-clarity-development-next-level">Clarinet</a> can help you avoid commonly made smart contract mistakes, the<a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarity-vscode-extension"> Clarity for VSCode</a> extension offers integral autocomplete features, and the<a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web"> Hiro Web Wallet</a> is how users will actively interact with your app. Got questions?

        '<p>This Stacker Chat episode provides an overview as to the <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> of CityCoins, and covers some highlights of building an open-source and community-run project. When building extremely complex smart contract protocols, Hiro solutions such as Clarinet were key in controlling compute costs and ensuring the launch could be a smooth one. Clarity and Clarinet combined ensured peace of mind for core contributors Patrick Stanley and Jason Schrader, and the project has put in the groundwork to accelerate engagement with the City of Miami government.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>“One thing that was extremely helpful throughout the whole process was the Clarinet tool. It allowed us to do a whole ton of testing. We actually ran over 140 different unit tests. We had about 95% code coverage, mostly because the VRF was random and we couldn\'t get to that full 100%. Everything we did was done with the mindset that you develop a feature, and then you test and test and test that feature. And then you test everything overall to make sure you\'re getting those expected results.”</blockquote><p>The first CityCoin to launch, MiamiCoin has accrued over $4M USD value in STX for the City of Miami <a href="https://twitter.com/mineCityCoins/status/1435033199151702017?s=20">as of 9/6/2021</a>.

My name is Gina Abrams, and today I\'m excited to be joined by Patrick Stanley, founder of <a href="https://www.joinfreehold.com/">Freehold</a> and the community lead at <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/">CityCoins</a>. We\'re also joined by Jason Schrader, DevOps engineer at Freehold and a core contributor to CityCoins.<br></p><p>CityCoins is an open source, community-led initiative and we\'re going to dive into it today. Patrick, I\'d love to hear your background and how you fell in love with the crypto world and Bitcoin, and how it\'s led to where you are today.<br></p><h5><strong>— Patrick Stanley:</strong></h5><p>Yeah, so I was previously the head of growth at <a href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a>. I spun out, created Freehold, which is a community project where people contribute to their favorite projects. I fell in love with crypto back in 2012 when I discovered Bitcoin. The CityCoins project is really cool because I\'m just super into civic engagement and crypto. And this is the perfect place where it matched.<br></p><h5><strong>— Gina Abrams:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Very cool. Jason, you\'ve been in the Stacker community for a while. How has that led to your work at Freehold and CityCoins?<br></p><h5><strong>— Jason Schrader:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. Prior to really diving into the Stacks ecosystem, I owned my own IT company servicing small- and medium-sized businesses and did a whole bunch of work across a lot of different outlets. Over that time, I got this spark and interest in what Stacks was doing. I absolutely loved everything I got to do leading to the launch of Stacks 2.0, including working with some of the working groups. That’s how I met Patrick, in the business models group.<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>I am still active with the <a href="https://forum.stacks.org/t/about-the-governance-category/10376/2">governance working group</a>. We used to have a proof of transfer working group. That one is now long gone since we officially launched and things are alive. It’s been an amazing ecosystem to be a part of. When Patrick started Freehold, I reached out to him and said, "Hey, I want to be a part of this." And over time we found that we really enjoy how we worked together and took that to the next level. I\'ve been happy to handle everything on the DevOps and engineering side for Freehold.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Awesome. Patrick, how do you describe CityCoins?<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><blockquote>CityCoins democratizes city engagement and allows you to put cities in your portfolio. How I like to look at them is a third way of voting, in a way.&nbsp;<br></blockquote><p>You can vote with your ballot in city elections. Half the time, you\'re not really super excited by the results. And even if you do get your candidate that you like, they don\'t always deliver. The other way you can vote is by voting with your feet, so exiting a city and essentially not being a customer anymore by paying taxes there.</p><p>Now the third way is with your coin. So if you\'re a holder of a CityCoin, you\'re committed to the city. If you\'re a buyer of a CityCoin, you\'re bullish on city leadership. If you\'re a seller of a CityCoin, you\'re bearish on city leadership. And developers can build for their city with CityCoins. You can also choose to take things into your own hands and essentially just build for your city as a developer.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Excellent. Now the first CityCoin, MiamiCoin, went live just a couple of weeks ago. Can you also provide a bit of background in how that works and how the launch has been?</p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, for sure. So MiamiCoin was launched by the community. There was no pre-mine, no ICO, no primary issuer. There were 20 individuals that launched it, 20 <a href="https://twitter.com/mineCityCoins/status/1423058379304366085?s=20">independent miners that signaled the beginning of mining</a>. Then about 150 blocks later (roughly a day later), mining began. How mining works is it essentially uses a generalized form of <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fcf9ac604d37418aa70a5ab/60072dbb32d416d6b3806935_5f1596b12bcc0800f3dcadcd_pox.pdf">proof of transfer</a>, the Stacks consensus mechanism. Although, I think we\'re starting to just call it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Pakr4iEpI">recycled proof of work</a> because that is what it is.</p><p>How it works is you forward a base currency, like Stacks, into the <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/miamicoin-how-to-mine-and-stack">mining mechanism</a> to compete for the chance to win that block. Right now, on average, there\'s 20 to 30 miners mining MiamiCoin at any given time. And one person, one miner, wins every block. Their chances of winning is weighted by how much they\'ve sent proportional to the rest of the gang who\'s been mining that block. So if you sent 100 stacks in, and the rest of the rest of the competitors sent 900 stacks in, you have a 10% chance of winning that block. So people are mining over many blocks and earning MiamiCoin that way.</p><p>Now, the base currency doesn\'t just go into a black hole. It gets forwarded directly to the city\'s treasury. So for the first 2100 blocks of the CityCoins existence, of MiamiCoin\'s existence, 100% of what the miners are forwarding to compete gets to the city wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>And at the time of this Zoom call (Aug. 18th, 2021), the reserved city wallet that the city can claim is about to hit $2 million. This all happened in 13 days from a standing start, from where there was nothing and no market cap. <em>*Update that as of Sept. 8th, 2021 the City of Miami reserve wallet </em><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelfau/status/1435034830119464960?s=20"><em>surpassed $4M</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em><br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Soon, <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/stacking#stacking-flow">Stacking</a> MiamiCoin will begin for the first time. Just like how Stacking works on Stacks, where <a href="https://www.stacks.co/stacking">you earn in Bitcoin</a>, when you <a href="https://docs.citycoins.co/citycoins-core-protocol/stacking-citycoins">Stack MiamiCoin</a>, you earn Stacks (STX), which, by the way, you can also Stack to earn Bitcoin. Starting tomorrow, instead of the city getting 100% of the proceeds, they\'ll start getting 30% of the proceeds. And 70% will go directly to holders of MiamiCoin. So the holders of MiamiCoin will earn Stacks. Was that a good explanation, I hope?<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, I just want to add one thing at the end there. So with regard to Stacking, the people who earn through that 30/70 split of the protocol are the MiamiCoin Stackers. So it\'s not just the MiamiCoin holders in general, but it\'s those who choose to <a href="https://docs.citycoins.co/citycoins-core-protocol/stacking-citycoins">lock their MiamiCoin up in the contract</a> for a set number of award cycles.<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>One other thing we can note about that is when you go to Stack, you can Stack for one cycle, which is 2100 blocks, about two weeks, as mentioned. And you can actually stack for a maximum of 32 cycles, which would equal about 16 months if we go off an average of a 10 minutes block time. So there\'s a lot of variability available there. And there is a cool-down cycle between Stacking cycles for MiamiCoin, similar to what we see in Stacks today. So let\'s say you were to Stack for cycle one and two, you\'d be able to claim everything back in cycle three. And you would then be able to Stack from cycle four forward.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Thank you. It sounds like MiamiCoin has a potential to really use crypto to create real social impact for ordinary citizens. What specific use cases do you think that cities might use their treasuries for?<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, great question. I think they\'re going to use it to recruit crypto startups so they can essentially attract talent and customers to their city. Those people are all taxable once they move to the city. They might use it to subsidize WiFi in underprivileged homes, disaster relief, combating climate change, like building levies and trying to, essentially, modernize their city. I think some cities will try to do things like UBI.<br></p><p>Mind you, mining coins at a billion dollars is creating, roughly, $40-100 million for the city annually. That\'s insane, by the way. That is insane. They already earned $2 million in two weeks, and they haven\'t even claimed their protocol contribution. It hasn\'t even been listed on an exchange.<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>So that\'s enough, by the way, to offset their entire municipal debt bond servicing. That\'s jaw-dropping. MiamiCoin at $10 billion creates enough revenue where, hypothetically, the city wouldn\'t even have to charge taxes to their residents. The possibilities are really endless in terms of what they can use it for. And I think the market of MiamiCoin holders will largely have a feedback loop with the city in terms of being like, "Yes, I like what they\'re using these funds on. Or, "No, I don\'t like what they\'re using their funds on." So it\'s a concept of thumbs up or thumbs down.<br></p><p>You can take that a step further, and the city could say, "Hey, we really like that feedback mechanism. We\'d love you to be more prescriptive, so we know what you really like. So how about you token holders, you vote on things that you think we should spend the money on. And then we designate 50% of what we earned to go toward things that the token holders vote on. And we trial that out and see how that works." I think that\'s really cool, and that\'s direct democracy in a way.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>That\'s incredible. It sounds like a ton of upside for cities. What are some potential challenges to this novel concept?&nbsp;<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>It\'s been pretty smooth so far, I got to say. There are little speed bump sized challenges that you get over immediately, but I\'ll list maybe one or two. One is that most cities can\'t hold crypto on their balance sheet. And so what they\'ve got to do is immediately convert their crypto earnings into USD. That\'s fine. It\'d be better if they could hold the crypto on their balance sheet, even better if they can mine their own coin. They\'re going to want to mine their own coin, by the way. That\'d be fortifying their treasury. It would be a fiduciary duty.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That was a little mini hurdle, but that was easily overcome-able. I think a lot of operators of most cities probably don\'t know how crypto works, but they do know that they want to fund the city. So it\'s almost like there\'s an educational onboarding that needs to be done with them before they\'re like, "Oh, I get it. This is built on Bitcoin. It\'s hyper secure. It generates income for the city. Developers can program with it. Cool. And also, I can put down the contribution at any time, and essentially end this at any time if we feel like it\'s not good."&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>Governments have total power to participate or not participate. So they feel really in control. They\'re welcoming crypto as a tool to use.</blockquote><p>Anything that you would say, Jason, from your perspective?<strong>‍</strong><br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>You definitely hit it on the head as far as our relations and what it\'s been like to go through this process with the first city. We are learning from this, we\'re also taking that and abstracting it to what it could look like as things expand and change. On the technical side, we ran into some interesting challenges along the way, in regards to Clarity and some of the ways we were doing our testing. But I\'m sure we\'ll talk about that a little later.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, the MiamiCoin <a href="https://github.com/citycoins/citycoin">Clarity Smart Contract</a> is super complex - likely a number of smart contracts working together in managing the city\'s treasury, allowing users to register for mining, to claim rewards, configure stacking, and set up a token. So much is being done through the smart contract language for Stacks, Clarity. How has your experience engineering these smart contracts needed for CityCoins? What Clarity features streamlined the process?<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, definitely. When you talk about all the different functions that we have, it\'s interesting to note that when we originally started, we started with a single contract thinking that we could do it all in one piece. It ended up turning into much more of a protocol. We have <a href="https://docs.citycoins.co/citycoins-core-protocol/citycoin-contracts">three contracts that are focused on the city</a>, mostly the core and the token are the widely known ones. And then a <a href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0x6e18dbc3a687270a7015ebef73a590d4f066538b41bf7cb7c8d7d891b6442964">general VRF</a>. That actually would be used by all CityCoins, and just computes a random number based on the block height, looking about 100 blocks back.<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>So we\'ve got this system in place. We implemented two <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#impl-trait">Clarity traits</a>, and that was a really helpful feature to say, "Hey, as we launch new cities, or as things follow this protocol, we know that at least they\'re going to contain the same <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions">functions</a>. They\'re going to have very similar functionality, and they\'re going to follow a set of rules that we set forward." So in that sense, breaking it up into contracts ended up being a really cool way to look at how these different contracts can call and talk to each other. There was definitely an order of operations when it comes to how they were initialized and before registration began.<br></p><p>Overall, it was a very comfortable process. It takes a little while to get used to the parentheses, but once you do that, and once you start to look at how you actually format your functions, it becomes a very readable and easy to understand language. By the end of it, I\'ve really enjoyed the process of programming in Clarity.<br></p><blockquote>One thing that was extremely, extremely helpful throughout the whole process was the Clarinet tool. And so Clarinet allowed us to do a whole ton of testing. We actually ran over 140 different unit tests. We had about 95% code coverage, mostly because the VRF was random and we couldn\'t get to that full 100%. But everything we did was done with the mindset that you develop a feature, and then you test and test and test that feature. And then you test everything overall to make sure you\'re getting those expected results.</blockquote><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>With that combination of what we had, just through some simple NPM scripts and with using Clarinet as our testing framework, it really made us confident that whatever those outcomes we expected were definitely going to work that way. Another thing that was really useful there was the cost testing that came through Clarinet.&nbsp;<br></p><p>What we didn\'t realize in the very first version of the contract was that some of what we were trying to do in Clarity was expensive. When I say expensive, there are certain cost constraints that are composed of different contracts and functions as they cover how much they read, how much they write, and what the runtime cost is. Now, if you exceed certain thresholds on these, it means you can only fit a certain amount of transactions in the block.<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>So one thing that we really started going through with Clarinet was checking, "Okay, when you go to mine MiamiCoin, for example, how much does that transaction cost? And how can we reduce those costs to the lowest numbers possible?" <br></p><blockquote>There were a few design patterns that evolved out of that. We actually went from having about a 50% runtime cost, which means it was a giant transaction, took up half the block down, to right near 1% for a single transaction. And that type of change is what allows room for this type of thing to scale and allows more people to participate and just to make it a more open process.</blockquote><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Wow. Thank you for that overview. And I\'m curious in terms of the user flows and any other tools that you\'re using within the Stack\'s ecosystem or tools that have been built by the open source community, how has the feedback been in terms of the user experience? Are there any things that you\'d highlight in terms of tools that were super helpful or that you\'re getting feedback on?<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>The <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web">Hiro web wallet</a> was pretty great, wouldn\'t you say?<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, the web wallet with <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/hstove-feat/sip-10-ft/sips/sip-010/sip-010-fungible-token-standard.md">SIP-10 token</a> support already. This token is one of the first SIP-10 tokens to actually exist. I think we\'re going to push the standard to be ratified based on this launch and everything happening here. With that, it came with just some of that novel nature of things, where it was like, "Hey, this is something that really hasn\'t been done before on this scale on mainnet."</p><blockquote>So far, it\'s been really cool using the Hiro web wallet to be able to send, receive, and to interact with these smart contracts. Being able to use the Stacks Connect Library was very, very useful with that as well. Because then you can pull in the application, you can have log in, the authentication and everything like that.</blockquote><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>And of course, <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js">Stacks.JS</a>. So you have a ton of libraries there. Mainly network and transactions were the ones we get the most, but there\'s a lot that you can do both in being able to talk to a contract and to interpret the data from it. Because Clarity has a very strict type system. And based on that, the helpers that were available in those packages made it really easy to, for example, look at the hex of the transaction and be able to break that down and say, "Okay, that was actually somebody submitted an amount for mining and presenting that in UI."</p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Thank you so much. Now, this again is an open source project. It\'s a community-run initiative. I know there\'s a number of core contributors. How has that experience been and what are you excited for looking ahead?<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>What was really fun about that was just being able to work with a community effort and to handle things. It was a lot of chatting. It was a lot of late night coding. It was a lot of back and forth on GitHub and doing the peer review back and forth. And I do have to say there were several members of the Stacks ecosystem that were very helpful, even in just answering questions, thinking through theories, looking over pieces of code. And with that, we were able to really take this to the next level.</blockquote><p>And what we have now is not only focusing on the success of Miami, and focusing on the success of this as a protocol, but allowing that protocol to grow outside of this as well so that we can see, what does it look like with 2, 3, 5, 10 up to 200 cities online. And those types of ambitious goals really take us to look at what we\'ve done, look at how we can improve, and how to make this the best experience ever.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Thank you. The team just kicked off the MiamiCoinMakers Month, a month-long remote hackathon for building public utilities using Miami Coin. I\'d love to hear a little bit more about this. And what are some of the products that you\'d really be excited to see in the ecosystem?<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, sure. So <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover">Ryan Hoover</a> from Product Hunt is judging this. I\'m actually a judge as well. And another judge is <a href="https://twitter.com/BoredElonMusk">BoredElonMusk</a>, the parody account who\'s constantly coming up with fun ideas, acting like he\'s Elon Musk who\'s just bored coming up with ideas. There\'s about 100 hackers that have signed up. Some people have started building. One idea was that DAO idea I was mentioning earlier where people can vote on what the government uses their funds for.<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Another that\'s pretty cool that\'s being built is this proof of HODL, proof of holding the coin, proof of HODL, access control to physical spaces. So you essentially have little mini Miami apartments or work areas or cafes, which are only accessible by holding it. Even a small amount of MiamiCoin, a penny worth, one MiamiCoin. That\'s cool. Instead of signing in with your name, it\'s sign in with your wallet, sign in with your balance, sign in with your keys. And that\'s pretty interesting. Conceptually that blends. The line between citizen and stakeholder and city limits, the boundaries of a city, really started to blur with that concept because you could have a MiamiCoin apartment building in Berlin. When you come in here, you\'re entering Miami in a way. And that\'s pretty fascinating.<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>It\'s also calling to mind something I\'ve noticed with this project, is it\'s not attracting die hard Libertarians or Democrats or Republicans or anything.&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>I think this is a unity project. People who value civic engagement, value their community, but also value building things and building real useful stuff that generate wealth for society. I think they\'re all on the same page here.</blockquote><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>I guess one just random thought was on, you can imagine a world where there\'s hundreds of CityCoins. And mind you, people who live in cities don\'t hold municipal debt, but they probably would hold CityCoins. So this is a way for people to become stakeholders in their favorite cities, regardless of whether they live in them.<br></p><p>If you imagine a world where there\'s hundreds of CityCoins. The customer, the end user, I wouldn\'t be able to really pinpoint a political ideology on that person. I\'d say that person\'s just interested in making the world better in some way and wants to have skin in the game. That\'s pretty awesome. And I think I wouldn\'t say there\'s a new political party or anything like that. I think it\'s just people that want to help win essentially, but this is new. There\'s a new thing that\'s cropping out of this. This is just people who are fascinated by this and want to get involved.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, absolutely. How should folks get involved if they\'re interested in starting to hack on a project or being a contributor to MiamiCoinand CityCoin, really?<br></p><h5><strong>— PS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah, there is a chat app on Discord just called <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tANUVBz9bk">Chat.CityCoins.co</a>. There\'s a huge community that\'s really active. They\'re having a ball. They\'re having a blast. And if you want to vote on which city should be next, I think the community is still figuring out how to launch new cities, how to let the city self-service, and self launch. So providing some input there will be directionally helpful for the community. And you can vote on your favorite city anywhere in the world at <a href="https://www.citycoins.co/">citycoins.co</a>. Just go in and vote.&nbsp;<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Yeah. For the Hackathon, you can go to <a href="http://miamimakers.co">Miamimakers.co</a>. And that will redirect you to the Eventbrite page for the hackathon. On the development side, I wanted to note, too, that we\'re trying to make the documentation really the go-to source of truth. The documentation lives within the CityCoins organization on GitHub, but it also lives at <a href="http://docs.citycoins.co">docs.citycoins.co</a>. And there\'s a ton there about the protocol, the different contract functions, how different parts operate, as well as some links back to different Stacks resources around Clarity, and some of those transaction libraries I mentioned earlier. So if it\'s something you feel called to be involved in, I would say start there. And if there\'s any questions, we\'re always available in the chat. We\'re always looking for more people to contribute.</p><h5><strong>— GA:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Thank you both so much for your time. That\'s a wrap on the CityCoins, MiamiCoins episode, but we\'re definitely going to share some resources down below. Thank you both so much, and we\'ll see you soon.<br></p><h5><strong>— JS:&nbsp;</strong></h5><p>Thank you!</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1079px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1079px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61001f37d9b8a89b4411a7bd_Asset%2028.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xNLj2Mu7fW-BCq-vC9xKQ">Hiro Youtube Channel</a> to watch new weekly Stacker Chats!<br></p>',

      name: "Diwaker Gupta @ Chainlink’s #SmartCon - Understanding Smart Contracts for Bitcoin",
      "post-body":
        '<h1>Smart Contracts Status Report</h1><p>Gupta, who is VP of Technology at Hiro, kicked off his talk by defining some terms. “In some circles, saying things like DeFi on Bitcoin or smart contracts for Bitcoin can be confusing at best... and triggering at worst,” he said. “So let me start by defining what I mean by smart contracts for Bitcoin…”.</p><p>For Gupta, smart contracts for Bitcoin must be:</p><ul><li>Permission-less</li><li>Trust-less</li><li>React to BTC state</li><li>Change BTC state</li></ul><p>Next, Diwaker took a look at how <a target="_blank" href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a>, the smart contracting language which runs on Stacks blockchain, holds up to these standards. “Based on what we\'ve seen in the ecosystem so far, Clarity on Stacks meets the bar for being a permission-less and a trust-less environment. So now, the key questions are, can a Clarity contract react to events happening on the Bitcoin chain... and can they make state changes on Bitcoin? Because then, you have a really full-fledged system!”<br></p><blockquote>“Can [Clarity contracts] make state changes on Bitcoin? Because then, you have a really full-fledged system!" </blockquote><p>He then shared a recent, real-world example that supports Clarity’s ability to react to events happening on the Bitcoin chain. Someone in the Stacks community <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fmdroid/status/1418533936498724874">recently executed a trust-less swap of an NFT on Bitcoin</a>, using a Clarity contract on Stacks. First, the NFT was transferred to a smart contract on Stacks. Then, a regular transaction was made via Bitcoin. That triggered the smart contract to verify that the Bitcoin payment did actually occur, and when this verification was completed, the smart contract released the NFT to the payee. “Note that the only thing someone had to do to actually trigger the swap is to send a regular Bitcoin transaction to a specific wallet. That\'s it,” said Gupta. </p><p>As to the question of whether or not Clarity contracts can make state changes on Bitcoin, Gupta says Stacks is making progress. Stacks miners are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stxstats.co/">currently generating Bitcoin transactions</a> whose outputs are governed by the Stacks consensus protocol. “Large parts of the consensus mechanism in Stacks are expressed in a smart contract, and what the smart contract does then influences the Bitcoin transaction that Stacks miners send out,” said Gupta. “This is an active area of research in the Stacks community right now. </p><p>So now that Clarity on Stacks can enable smart contracts for Bitcoin, what can you do with it? For one, Gupta says, devs can create truly differentiated DeFi products on Stacks. “Imagine a negative interest loan that pays itself back over time, or an NFT that is earning a passive yield in Bitcoin, or programmable Bitcoin futures,” said Gupta. “These are all uniquely possible only on Stacks because of the consensus mechanism and the access to Bitcoin state that Clarity contracts can have.”</p><h1>Writing a Clarity Smart Contract on Stacks</h1><p>Would you ever sign that contract that you couldn’t read? Can you imagine putting your name on the dotted line for a mortgage in a language you don’t know? Then why would you do the same with a smart contract? These are the questions <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MarvinJanssen/">Marvin Janssen</a>, Technical Lead at the <a target="_blank" href="https://stacks.org/">Stacks</a> Foundation, posed at the start of his developer’s session about building smart contracts with Clarity.</p><p>“Why would you interact and submit your tokens to a smart contract that you can\'t read, that\'s compiled into byte code that\'s very difficult to analyze for its correctness, and that may have hidden features that you don\'t know about? That’s why Clarity is interpreted,” Janssen explained. “That way, how you write the contract is exactly how it\'s going to be broadcast on-chain and deployed.”</p><p>In addition to being interpreted as opposed to compiled, Janssen delved into some of Clarity’s other <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.blockstack.org/bringing-clarity-to-8-dangerous-smart-contract-vulnerabilities/">benefits</a>, including:</p><ul><li>Clarity is decidable (non-Turing complete)</li><li>Reentrancy is not permitted</li><li>No underflows and overflows</li><li>Built-in support for custom tokens/your own NFTs</li><li>Transactions are secured by post-conditions</li></ul><p>After giving context to some of the language’s strengths, he drilled down on how to build a Clarity basic smart contract on Stacks with a helpful tutorial (to get his step-by-step instructions, view the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAVwd6SNJVU">full video</a>). Then, he answered audience questions about reentrancy, writing for multiple NFTs, and getting started with Clarity.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAVwd6SNJVU"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OAVwd6SNJVU"></iframe></div></figure><p>Janssen also shared some exciting news about a new initiative: <a target="_blank" href="https://stacks.org/clarity-universe">Clarity Universe</a>. “The Stacks Foundation is spearheading this educational project which anyone can join, whether you’re a beginning developer, you\'re just interested in developing but haven\'t done anything quite yet, or are experienced,” he said. “You can learn Clarity from start-to-finish, and it’s free to join.

We also have a <a target="_blank" href="https://stacks.org/grants">grants program</a> with the Stacks Foundation. So, if you have an idea that moves forward that user-owned internet, come talk to us.

        '<p>Philip is a long time Bitcoiner who started out with the simple question: how to borrow against his own assets as cheaply as possible? Once Stacks 2.0 went live with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/proof-of-transfer">Proof of Transfer</a>, the novel consensus mechanism that connects the Stacks and Bitcoin blockchains and enables participants to earn Bitcoin rewards — the answer became more clear.</p><blockquote>"We want to make it easy to get access to liquidity and to borrow against your own assets on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging the security of Bitcoin.”</blockquote><p>The Arkadiko team uses Hiro solution <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarinet-taking-clarity-development-next-level">Clarinet</a> to manage the over thirty Clarity smart contracts in play building the fully decentralized DeFi protocol on Stacks. Arkadiko will go live as a Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with governance token (<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.arkadiko.finance/protocol/diko">$DIKO</a>) and liquidity rewards for users. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web">Hiro Web Wallet</a> and Hiro-supported <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/testnet">testnet</a> infrastructure provided an easy path for community testing and auditing the protocol. <br></p><p>The Arkadiko suite of DeFi tools are anticipated to go live on mainnet in Q4, 2021. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Fo97Bp2SA&t=3s&ab_channel=Hiro"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1Fo97Bp2SA?start=3"></iframe></div></figure><p>The full episode is available on YouTube.

My name is <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Gina__Abrams">Gina Abrams</a> and I\'m thrilled to be joined by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/philipdesmedt">Philip De Smedt</a>, Core Contributor at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a>. Arkadiko is a crypto protocol for loans that repay themselves through the first stablecoin, called USDA, where your collateral earns a yield. Philip is a successful entrepreneur, Bitcoin educator, and globetrotter. Thanks for being here, Philip, where are you calling in from, and how\'s everything going?<br></p><h5><strong>— Philip De Smedt:</strong></h5><p>Hey Gina, happy to be here. It\'s an honor to share this with likes of <a href="https://twitter.com/muneeb" target="_blank">Muneeb</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/TO">Trevor</a>, and probably a lot of amazing other people in the future. Today I\'m in Switzerland, but like you said I travel pretty much all throughout Europe. These days mostly by car. Today Switzerland, but often I\'m in Spain or Belgium.<br></p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Awesome! Well thank you for calling in, and I\'d love to dive in and hear a bit about your background and the history behind Arkadiko.<br></p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Yeah. Great! So I got into Bitcoin around late 2013, and I got a pretty rough lesson that I think everyone should probably go through. I bought at the almost absolute top, so I became a “HODLer” immediately. So this is kind of my third cycle, so 2013, 2017 and now 2020/2021. I\'ve always been in technology. Previously, we had set up a SAAS company, and we sold the company about two years ago. I always wanted to be in the crypto ecosystem, specifically in Bitcoin, but there were just not that many options in Bitcoin to build smart contracts at the time. </p><blockquote>When Stacks 2.0 launched only seven months ago, I was super excited because it was really the first blockchain that allowed me to build smart contracts that anchor to Bitcoin.</blockquote><p>At a high level, that\'s where I come from. I have a technical background, love playing with technology, and am excited to build Arkadiko.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Now, why do I mention Bitcoin? Obviously, because Stacks settles on it, right? For me, Bitcoin is two things. First of all, I think it\'s the hardest, most sound money that we have ever known as humankind. It\'s also the most global and dominant digital monetary network. You can think of it as a set of nodes. </p><p>It\'s those two things. Bitcoin, the “asset”, that\'s what most people refer to when they talk about Bitcoin. It\'s very liquid. It has amazing price discovery. It settles really quick. You have finality in something like an hour. It\'s really easy to send abroad, for instance.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>I just love the properties of Bitcoin as a network and as an asset. And I think for me, that\'s where Stacks came in, because I could start using both the security of Bitcoin, as well as the assets to build smart contracts that settle on Bitcoin. And that\'s really the day, somewhere in January/February of this year, when our Arkadiko was born.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>I started thinking, how can I borrow against my own assets? And how can I make it as inexpensive as possible for a person? That\'s where the self repaying loan angle really comes in. You have proof of transfer, which is the consensus mechanism of Stacks.</p><blockquote>Proof of transfer is not only great for you as a Stacker individually, but for me as a developer. I can reuse the protocol. That\'s where Arkadiko shines. We integrated proof of transfer as a building block into our own stablecoin, and that\'s where the collateral on your yield comes from.</blockquote><p>So long story short: we want to make it easy to get access to liquidity and to borrow against your own assets on the Stack\'s blockchain, leveraging the security of Bitcoin.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Fascinating. Thank you! Now you had a really successful <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/regtest">Regtest</a> launch with over seven million USDA, that\'s the Arkadiko stablecoin minted by the community. I\'d love to hear some of the learnings and benefits of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.arkadiko.finance/regtest-faq">launching on Regtest</a>, and what are the current priorities for the team as you look ahead toward a mainnet launch.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>As you said, the reception from the community was amazing. I did not expect seven million to be minted, and it was really in like four or three days or something that it blew up. It was amazing. I think the reason we wanted to launch was not only to get confirmation that people wanted to use this (because we needed to figure out if we had product market fit). That was a great test. Additionally, we wanted to see how <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/overview">Clarity</a> works in practice? I think Arkadiko today is one of, if not the largest, set of smart contracts that is being launched on Stacks. As a whole, I think we have about between <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/arkadiko-dao/arkadiko/tree/master/clarity/contracts">30 and 40 smart contracts</a> that work together today. It\'s a very complex architecture, at least to me! Maybe people smarter than myself would disagree, but I believe it’s fairly complex. </p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Obviously there were some UI/UX issues, but the big takeaway was that this product is something people want. </p><blockquote>People get really excited if they hear they can borrow against their own assets, earn a yield of about 7-8%.</blockquote><p>It was great validation. That was two months ago, and now we are getting ready for a mainnet launch. We are currently in a code freeze, meaning we finished the product. We shipped that off as a package to our security auditor, and they\'re working on it as we speak. I\'m super excited. Our launch date is in Q4, and a more specific date will be published on our Twitter soon. I can\'t really say any specifics about that yet, but it\'s going to come real soon within the next three months or so.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Awesome. Now I think we dove pretty straight into some of the specifics there, and how these 30 to 40 Clarity smart contracts that are all interacting together. Maybe if we could bring it back to the different components to Arkadiko. How does it stand apart from existing DeFi protocols that are out there in the market today?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>A lot of the tools that we use in Arkadiko, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarinet-taking-clarity-development-next-level">Clarinet</a>, have been a huge help. </p><blockquote>The Hiro web wallet was immediately implemented so the community could use the platform. A lot of the development tooling was super helpful in just putting those 40 contracts together. Clarinet was instrumental to what we have put together and engineered. Without it, it would’ve been pretty rough.</blockquote><p>One of the main core maintainers, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ludovic?lang=en">Ludo Galabru</a>, has been holding my hand throughout. There\'s a lot I have to say, but super helpful tool. I can recommend it to any team that wants to get started with Clarity.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>I would say we differentiate from other DeFi protocols in the way we generate a yield for you that\'s inherent to our stablecoin. Additionally, our smart contracts are obviously written in Clarity, and we\'re going to deploy to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain">Stacks blockchain</a>. </p><blockquote>So we\'re “native” to the Stacks blockchain. That gives you a lot of insight as an end user into how the system operates. Everything is transparent on the blockchain. You can read any contracts.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/theres-nowhere-to-hide-with-clarity">We have nothing to hide.</a></p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>It\'s very easy to do an audit on Arkadiko if you know how to read some code. I think proof of transfer and the integration that we did with Arkadiko is something that is blowing people\'s minds. If you look at the ecosystem, and you look at the yields that are being generated, often they get advertised as high yields. This means you get 50-60% APR, but I always ask people: "Where does that yield come from?" Quite often, the yield comes from their governance token, which quite frankly is worth nothing a lot of the time. I think the real differentiator here is proof of transfer. </p><blockquote>You get paid in Bitcoin, which is a scarce asset. As I mentioned, it\'s the most powerful asset, and you get paid in it while borrowing. I do think that\'s one of the biggest differentiators that any user of Arkadiko is looking for today.</blockquote><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Absolutely. If you can just break it down for audience: What\'s that user journey look like? When it comes to collateralizing a stablecoin, how are they going to receive the yield? What can folks really expect upon launch?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>It works by taking your STX tokens and locking them. You deposit them into what we call an <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.arkadiko.finance/protocol/vaults">Arkadiko vault</a>. An Arkadiko vault is simply a smart contract implemented in Clarity. The name of it is vault. Once STX tokens are deposited in the vault, Arkadiko acts as a stacking pool towards proof of transfer. We group all those STX together, and we have an internal bookkeeping service. We might say: “Okay, Gina. You created a vault of 1000 STX, and you are eligible for your pro-rata share of what is in the pool.”</p><p>You can choose to let the loan repay itself, so you don\'t have to do anything. You don\'t have to think of monthly repayments or fear of liquidations because your collateralization is really high.</p><p><strong>The point is your loan is paid off on its own in a trustless way, so you don\'t have to intervene. You just sit there and it\'s all automated. That\'s one option. The other option that we launch with is a self repaying loan, but without the option of having the automatic payments triggered. Meaning we would give you yield in the STX token, and just add that onto your vault. This means that your collateralization goes up, but those additional yields (those additional stacks tokens) would get “stacked” as well in a subsequent cycle. It would not be in the same cycle, because that\'s not possible! It creates this compounding yield.</strong></p><p>There\'s really two options for people who do not want to worry. There’s automatic repayments, but for people who want to go a bit more advanced they can compound their own STX.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Awesome. One other thing that I\'m curious about is your vision for this product. Is it something that you\'re anticipating STX holders, bitcoiners, and folks across the crypto industry use 5-10 years down the line as this incredible protocol for the internet?! I\'d love to hear, what are your thoughts for the future?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>With a stablecoin, there\'s really endless amounts of use-cases. One of the first things, and I\'ll try to go chronologically, that we will focus on from launch is getting out into the Stacks community. We want to talk to them, because they\'re the most important! Let\'s call them a “cohort”, or a group of people that we want to target.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>It’s probably safe to say that a lot of Stacks people, they are bullish on Stacks: the asset. They just want to get more of it! I already explained how the self compounding yield mechanism works. We act as a pool, and you get yields and that are added to your collateral. That\'s one way that you get more yields, but it\'s the same as it would be with stacking and proof of transfer.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Now let’s say you minted USDA against your own possessions. You deposit $1000 worth in STX tokens. Against that, let’s say you mint $250. With those 250 USDA you can buy additional STX. You\'re leveraging yourself with fairly low risk, but getting more STX exposure. We are helping users who want this type of opportunity, leveraging themselves in a low-risk scenario.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Another thing that I would love to do is collaborate with existing wallets in the ecosystem and make it really easy to interact with our smart contracts. DeFi is still a fairly advanced concept. There is still a steep learning curve in comparison to NFTs for example. An NFT, as a piece of digital art, is really easy to get. I just buy a token for the NFT. With DeFi you have a lot more complex concepts, such as governance tokens, that might or might not be worth anything.</p><p>The public often says: “Woah! This sounds complicated”. </p><blockquote>There\'s a lot of education that needs to be done around DeFi, and we want to make it easy for those beginners. We want to create financial inclusion for casual users that want to access DeFi, but don\'t necessarily want to be a power user.</blockquote><p>That\'s why we\'re speaking to wallet creators to integrate our smart contracts and abstract everything away. Let’s say you have two positions: your STX positions (say again, 1000 STX tokens) and also one half of a BTC in your wallet. Next to those assets could be buttons for "Lend USDA" or "Earn yield on your BTC". Those buttons would automatically be interacting with our smart contracts, without a user directly interfacing with our contracts.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Another strategy is to spread awareness on DeFi and get financial inclusion for those people who own BTC and STX, but aren\'t very comfortable installing a web wallet or something like that. We want to help those people as well. Ultimately, that’s five to ten years out, but I saw a question that was recently asked on Twitter, "Are you planning to do a credit card? Can I pay with USDA or my yield? What I staked and earned, can I pay with that?".</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Now, I think that\'s a great idea. However, there\'s one caveat. One thing to consider is how we are aiming to be a decentralized protocol. We don\'t necessarily want to be the central entity that is a fiat on and off ramp, and helps you do payments in real life, physically.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Now I do think it\'s an interesting idea, and we have brainstormed about this with the team, but this is a little bit further out. We would have to set up some kind of central entity either with the same or different name. It would interface with the Arkadiko smart contracts in a similar fashion that your wallets would do once we have those integrations going.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>I think a lot of what I said boils down to is providing liquidity, in terms of providing leverage. You get access to the financial tools without having to worry, and without being a power user. We\'re really excited about building that out in the next few years.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Absolutely. I think we\'re definitely seeing the need for that across the board when it comes to DeFi. You brought up an interesting point there when it came to the complexities. These underlying protocols managed by smart contract give a lot of power to end users. Obviously, within the crypto world over the past 10 years or so, there\'s been learnings from different challenges that have come up.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>I think it highlights the importance of network resiliency and community. Arkadiko is an open source project, and it\'s also constructed as a DAO, or a decentralized autonomous organization. Can you talk a little bit more about that, and how it sort of came to be? What are you envisioning for the future?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Yeah, I think it\'s one of the pillars of Arkadiko. </p><p><strong>I mentioned we don\'t want to be a centralized entity in five years run by suits. We don\'t want to be compared to corporate America. It’s very important to have voting and buy-in from the community. If you look at our governance token, DIKO, we have a supply after five years of 100 million. That means there will be 100 million tokens in existence. 50 million of those will go to the community in terms of staking incentives, but we also have a treasury within the DAO, as a treasury. There is a dedicated amount of tokens that will be airdropped to people if they do challenges. There is more than one way to earn DIKO.</strong></p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>You could potentially earn DIKO by collaborating in hackathons, or building projects using our stablecoin. The point is we have those 100 million tokens and the majority of them should really belong to the community. For example, in the first six weeks after mainnet launch we could give away 1.5 million DIKO tokens to everyone who creates a vault. Imagine you create a vault, and you get your pro-rata amount against the collateral that you deposited. We want people to participate not only in terms of ownership of our token, but also in terms of governance. We want them to help us make protocol decisions. Hypothetically, if the community thinks we need to expand, get an investor on board, search for partnerships, etc., it\'s not really up to me or up to the team! It\'s up to that community as a whole.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>If you own a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.arkadiko.finance/protocol/diko">DIKO token</a>, you can start a governance vote. There are super majority votes and there are normal majority votes. A normal majority vote is 51% approximately, and super majority is 75%. If such a governance proposal succeeds, I cannot say we\'re not going to do it. In fact, I don’t even have the ability to. We have to execute the proposal. That\'s the bottom line, and the goal of what we\'re trying to achieve. We want the community as a whole to make those decisions together. Obviously, that\'s in the best interest of everyone. It\'s somewhere between making the right decision for you, but also for the community as a whole.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>As an example, let’s say you pay interest on the USDA that you mint. Imagine that you, Gina, open a $1000 vault again. That\'s $250 of collateral you\'re borrowing against those $1000. On that $250, you pay a small interest (it will be about 1-3% a year). That number is dynamic and could change through governance. If users think it\'s too expensive or too cheap, because there are those vote decisions, they can launch a vote to change that number.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>The interest us obviously revenue for us as the protocol, and in the best interest of the community we will spend that income. My point again is we don\'t make the decisions, but you as the community will.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Awesome. Thank you! I guess I\'m curious to dive a little bit deeper into how you\'re building this business after having been in the crypto industry for years. What are some of the things that you\'re looking out for? Anything that you\'ve built into the underlying architecture of Arkadiko, with all this knowledge in mind?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Yeah! If I look at other projects, a basic mistake I see a lot is not having the right incentives for your community. That ties into greed. The founder usually starts a project and they take 60-80% of the token supply. What is the incentive for an end user then?! They don\'t have any voting power, nor do they share any economic or financial potential with the founders or with the protocol. That\'s something we looked at. I wouldn\'t call us a complete fair launch, because there is a small treasury for the DAO that we keep. Even if it\'s controlled through governance, it\'s not 100% of the tokens that we give away. We are however definitely on the fair side. We don\'t want to be greedy.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>We want to bring the community along with us. If you look at Binance or Ethereum got launched really quick. They feel rushed and quite frankly like a cash grab just trying to make profit on top of the user. That\'s not something we want to do. We want to be transparent about how we launch our security audits, the results from those audits, our features, and our roadmap.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>And that\'s why I\'m also putting my name on the line. </p><p><strong>Look, I could have done this pseudonymously or anonymously. I could have said, "I\'m Philip, but I don\'t want people to know that I am launching Arkadiko." However, I don\'t have any issues putting my name on the line, because we want to do this transparently. We want to do this for the community and for the financial inclusion of Stacks users, or Ethereum users that want to come to Stacks.</strong></p><p>I\'m not a maxi, I\'m not opinionated, but I do think we\'re building the best protocol on Stacks. We\'re here for everyone. </p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>To that end, I\'d love to hear a little bit more about how are you looking for folks to get involved and follow along with Arkadiko, especially leading up to the mainnet launch. Is there\'s anything else in terms of incentives that folks can look out for?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>In terms of roadmap, I mentioned we finished up the product. We\'re going through a security audit currently. The only thing we want to do is integrate microblocks into our product. Once that\'s done, I think within the next three weeks, we will launch a really quick beta on the testnet. It\'s going to be a lot smaller than the previous Regtest soft launch. It\'s more for people who really can\'t wait for eight weeks.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>It\'s going to be smaller scale, just to show you the experience, if you want to run through a staking example, creating a vault, or doing anything to that extent. You will already have the real mainnet experience, but you can test on Testnet. We are fairly active and there for you on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/arkadikofinance?lang=en">Twitter</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/7NMUw482">Discord</a>.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>I don\'t know if people know, but I\'m Pipje on Discord. It\'s one of my nicknames from when I was younger. Feel free to hit me up there on the Arkadiko channel, or on <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/philipdesmedt">Twitter</a>. We\'re there to help you and answer any questions you might have. We also have a whitepaper that can be downloaded on <a target="_blank" href="http://arkadiko.finance">Arkadiko.finance</a>, and extensive documentation on <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.arkadiko.finance">docs.arkadiko.finance</a>. I think that should be sufficient, but speak to me for more information. Every person today who is interested in Arkadiko, I\'d love to have a conversation with. I want to hear what they think about the vaults, self repaying loans, and any future roadmap.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Yeah for sure, the website has super comprehensive information, great overviews, and graphs. I really love it as a resource. One thing I\'m curious about is, for folks that are potentially looking to build on Stacks, is there anything that is a wishlist item for you that you\'d love to see in the ecosystem? What would be some of your takeaways for those folks?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Yeah! There\'s one thing that I would love to see which is a stable swap. This means you trade a stablecoin against another stablecoin. That would be extremely helpful for us in terms of exchanging our stablecoin for another. I also think something like flash loans could be interesting. Flash loans are basically a loan that you take but has to be repaid in the same block. This enables all kinds of really interesting financial constructs. We are not working on that today, but I would love to see that type of mechanism through our stablecoin, for instance. I would generally say anything that uses proof of transfer in a novel way, because there are so many ways that we can still earn bitcoin as an underlying derivative. I\'m thinking of maybe an NFT that generates a bitcoin yield when you hold it, or something like that.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>I know <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/boom_wallet/status/1423351818621530121?s=20">boomboxes</a>, for instance, are something like that. Although there can be other novel approaches to it. My point is the possibilities are really endless, and proof of transfer enables all of it. I don\'t think we have to reinvent the wheel. </p><blockquote>There are great innovations and protocols on Ethereum, but we could bring those to Stacks. Some blockchain building blocks are helpful, but they will have more innovative potential if you leverage proof of transfer.</blockquote><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>That\'s what I always tell founders: "Look at proof of transfer". They always say: "Oh, I haven\'t read the white paper, or I haven\'t really looked at that." I tell them to <a target="_blank" href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fcf9ac604d37418aa70a5ab/60072dbb32d416d6b3806935_5f1596b12bcc0800f3dcadcd_pox.pdf">read that first</a>, and come back to me in a week. Then, the subsequent conversation is often very different from the first one.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Excellent. Thank you. We also had a few community questions. Are there plans for Arkadiko to distribute any profits from liquidations to DIKO holders? This would possibly come after the protocol launches, but curious about sort of what\'s going to be live at launch.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>When your vault needs to be liquidated, what we call a keeper has to buy up the collateral in an auction. There has to be an incentive for the keeper to buy up those STX tokens in an auction. If we would give a significant chunk of that revenue (that is usually reserved for that keeper) to people who are holding DIKO, it honestly depends on the incentive mechanism. The incentive might disappear for that keeper.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Quite frankly, I\'m not entirely convinced that would be the right model for us. Our stablecoin will only work if vault liquidations are efficient, and those keepers have the right incentives. Having said that, there\'s another way that we will share revenue with our community. I call them the “army of champions “. Everyone who stakes DIKO will be eligible for a part of the profit that Arkadiko makes. We will redistribute that profit to people staking in our staking module. I do think the revenue coming from there is indirectly tied to vault liquidations. If a vault gets liquidated, we make money as a protocol. We will distribute that profit through those stakers. Short answer is no, but the long answer is yes. Indirectly, you already receive part of those vault liquidations.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Very cool. Dialing into that question a teeny bit, will DIKO governance operate similarly to Maker? How will it differ? Any thoughts there?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Yeah, it\'s quite similar. You can launch governance votes and change certain parameters on collateral types. You can come up with novel approaches to do things, we\'re very open. In fact, our governance will launch the same day that we go live on mainnet. It will be twofold: the voting on a governance proposal will always be on-chain, but the discussions around that will happen on Dicourse, which is a forum software we\'re setting up and will be available for users on day one. I do think we are, in terms of incentives, a lot better than Maker. For instance, Maker does not support staking. It doesn\'t give the most optimal revenue share. We looked at those things and thought, we can do those better, and we improved upon them.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Great. You mentioned a little bit about the long-term vision for USDA, but can you talk a little bit about any near-term thoughts for fiat on and off ramps to of spend the minted stablecoin outside of the crypto ecosystem?</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Yeah. One option is, again, those integrations with wallets. Imagine it has a credit card linked to it. It says "buy", and you could buy through USDA. In the background, we would turn your USDA into something else (USDC, or maybe a STX token that you would end up buying). It would be abstracted away. Indirectly, the user would think that they are paying with USDA, while we do the conversion in the background. I do think I mentioned another option being the stable swaps. You could go easily from USDA into USDC (or another stablecoin that might come available on Stacks) quite easily through that stable swap. While that requires some intervention from the user, it\'s still a way to go for fiat. Having a credit card is probably not in the first year or so.</p><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Alrighty. Last question before I let you go. I\'d just love to hear at a high-level what\'s been a surprising or unexpected aspect of building an open source project in the Stacks ecosystem, and involving the whole community.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>One of the things that surprised me is how tight-knit the community really is. I posted some code on GitHub. It was open source, and without asking I got three or four reviews. I didn\'t ask anyone. It was just kind of someone saying, "Hey, maybe you could do this, or, hey I see a little bug there."</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>That was really cool to see, because Stacks is going to be successful if the developer ecosystem delivers protocols, such as Arkadiko. That has really been a positive experience.I think if you\'re on Discord, or if you\'re not, join Discord, and speak to some people. You\'ll definitely get some help, we\'ll brainstorm, and get some feedback.</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>That has been really surprising for me, because if you go to a bigger community like Ethereum, where do you get validation? Where do you get help? You\'re just a small fish in a gigantic pond where a lot of things are happening. </p><blockquote>I think that\'s the real, the Unique Selling Proposition (USP) today of Stacks: the developer ecosystem. We\'re here to help you, and to build together. It\'s all novel, including the POX. We’re really excited to see what comes in the next six months.</blockquote><h5><strong>— GA:</strong></h5><p>Very cool! Thank you so much, Philip, for being here. That\'s a wrap for today. For anyone that\'s interested in checking out documentation, check out some of the external links to the Arkadiko website and docs. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko.finance</a> has a ton of documentation, and definitely make sure to join our Discord where you can follow along with Arkadiko developments leading up to mainnet launch, which is happening sometime in Q4.</p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, please also subscribe to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xNLj2Mu7fW-BCq-vC9xKQ">Hiro YouTube channel</a>. We\'re going to continue having these conversations, and learning about these awesome projects. Thank you so much!</p><h5><strong>— PDS:</strong></h5><p>Cheers! 🥂</p>',

That is, until now.",
      name: "Bitcoin DeFi is Here: A Deep Dive into Trust-less Swaps",
      "post-body":
        '<p>Developers in the Stacks ecosystem recently demonstrated that Bitcoin DeFi is possible today. Longtime Stacks community members <a target="_blank" href="https://friedger.de/">Friedger Muffke</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SyAsteria">Asteria</a>, and <a href="http://www.judecnelson.com/">Jude Nelson</a> in collaboration with other Stacks community developers, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/fmdroid/status/1419645910049599494?s=20">deployed working Bitcoin swaps</a> with NFTs and other crypto-assets. <br></p><p>Native BTC swaps to new assets are a foundational building block of Bitcoin DeFi. In essence, Ethereum-like functionality is now possible directly on Bitcoin. This will lead to an explosion of advanced decentralized apps and Uniswap-like AMMs built around native BTC swaps, all using pure Bitcoin transactions and backed by the security of Bitcoin. <br></p><p>With this development, users will soon be able to do trust-less BTC swaps to stablecoins, derivatives, perpetuals, and other crypto assets built on Stacks, as well as purchase any digital assets (like NFTs and decentralized domains), all by pure Bitcoin transactions on the Bitcoin chain. With <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coindesk.com/usdc-stablecoin-could-soon-expand-to-10-more-blockchains">USDC coming to Stacks</a>, trust-less BTC/USDC swaps will be possible. This is a huge market — nearly $150M in daily volume that can be traded without exchanges! Similarly, xBTC will enable trust-less swaps of BTC for xBTC, which can then be used in a range of DeFi products. <br></p><p>In this post, I’ll focus on the recent trust-less swap development pioneered by Friedger and fellow devs in the Stacks ecosystem, and I’ll show you how you can try it yourself using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/overview">Clarity</a>. <br></p><p>But first, let’s talk about how we got to this point.<br></p><h2>True Bitcoin DeFi<br></h2><p>Bitcoin DeFi has historically been difficult due to Bitcoin’s limited scripting language, which doubles as its strength. Bitcoin is not easily programmable. Bitcoin purposefully hasn’t provided smart contract abilities as we’ve seen in other ecosystems. This was an intentional tradeoff to provide security and reliability for Bitcoin as a decentralized store of value. <br></p><p>Developers have tried to tackle this challenge by creating derivative Bitcoin assets that require centralized counter-parties or separate blockchains with wrapped BTC. But wrapped BTC is not Bitcoin, and many Bitcoiners don\'t trust the security and decentralization of separate blockchains or one-party custody solutions. There has been demand for DeFi-like products for Bitcoin on centralized alternatives, but <em>true</em> Bitcoin DeFi hasn’t been cracked til now. <br></p><p>And what do we mean by <em>true</em> Bitcoin DeFi? The key component is the ability to send an on-chain Bitcoin transaction and execute logic in a smart contract, thus removing the need for a central intermediary. <br></p><p>Stacks is uniquely positioned to enable true Bitcoin DeFi, given Stacks <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#get-block-info">contracts\' visibility into the Bitcoin state</a> as well as Stacks’ inherent ability to leverage Bitcoin’s security and settlement assurances. The Stacks chain is tethered to Bitcoin through its <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/proof-of-transfer" target="_blank">Proof of Transfer &nbsp;</a>consensus mechanism, so all Stacks transactions settle on Bitcoin. This ensures that Stacks shares Bitcoin’s long-term, unparalleled security for transaction reorgs. &nbsp;<br></p><h2>Introducing Catamaran Trust-Less Swaps<br></h2><p>Last month, Stacks community developers deployed working Bitcoin swaps with contracts that have unique visibility into Bitcoin state and that can trigger actions in Stacks-based smart contracts driven by pure Bitcoin transactions. These are currently being called “Catamaran swaps,” transactions that demonstrate a world of opportunity for Bitcoin DeFi applications enabled through Stacks. These are trust-less swaps, meaning there is zero reliance on any third party or custodial service to execute the swap — no KYC, no counter-party risk.<br></p><p>The term is an analogous extension of the more well-known concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://blockonomi.com/submarine-swaps/">Submarine swaps</a> in the Lightning community. Submarine swaps are atomic on-chain to off-chain swaps. Catamaran swaps are three leg swaps where two transactions happen on the Stacks chain and one transaction happens on the Bitcoin chain. In contrast to Submarine swaps where some actions happen on-chain (over water) and some off-chain (under water), all actions happen on-chain just on two different blockchains, hence Catamaran. <br></p><p>This implementation of Catamaran swaps relies on another Clarity contract that verifies that a given Bitcoin transaction was mined at a given block on the Bitcoin chain. The verification happens by comparing the hash of the provided block details with the hash viewable via <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#get-block-info">Clarity\'s block info</a> function. Then the merkle root of the Bitcoin transaction and the provided merkle proof is compared with the merkle root of the verified block. If these hashes are identical it can be concluded that the Bitcoin transaction was indeed included in the block on the Bitcoin chain. <br></p><p>Diving a bit deeper into the mechanics, in the first Stacks transaction a digital asset is placed into escrow of the smart contract and parameters like the Bitcoin receiver address, amount of BTC, time limit, etc., are defined for the swap. A Bitcoin transaction is then performed. Once confirmed, the second Stacks transaction verifies the Bitcoin transaction and releases the Stacks asset. </p><p>Written in Clarity, these swap contracts are only 70 lines long and use the verification logic of the Bitcoin library contract. A typical contract function that verifies BTC transactions looks like the following: </p><div></div><p>More contracts on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/friedger/clarity-friedger-pool">https://github.com/friedger/clarity-friedger-pool</a> </p><blockquote>Similar to swaps, other logic can be triggered when a Bitcoin transaction is triggered, e. g. pay back a loan, mint new tokens... (e.g. Friedger Pool mints wrapped stacking reward tokens for each Bitcoin reward transaction).</blockquote><p>Currently there are some technical restrictions that can make a trust-less swap fail. Bitcoin transactions that are too big (&gt;1024 bytes, &gt;8 ins or outs) or transactions that happen during a flash block cannot be verified on chain. Improvements will come with Stacks 2.1. Therefore, the current version of the swap contracts have a <em>cancel</em> function that releases the assets to the seller after a certain time limit. In these cases, the asset needs to be transferred manually. <br></p><h2>Improvements to Swaps<br></h2><p>These are the earliest days of development, and improvements can be made with Stacks 2.1 to reduce the number of transactions required in these interactions from 3 to 2, improve on flash block failures, unblock any other existing network limitations, and smooth the UI of such transactions both for end users and developers alike.<br></p><h2>Alternative Solutions<br></h2><p>Stacks is not the only project that is targeting Bitcoin DeFi, and rightly so given what is at stake for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Alternative wrapped Bitcoin assets on the market today have brought innovation to the space and in some cases have demonstrated meaningful traction. That said, none of these assets to date actually settles on Bitcoin — they settle on other networks, and some developers and users have questions about the assets’ security and decentralization.<br></p><p>There are also ongoing experiments such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rsk.co/">RSK</a> which bridges to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, <a target="_blank" href="https://lightning.engineering/">Lightning</a> which scales Bitcoin, and <a target="_blank" href="https://liquid.net/">Liquid</a> which uses a Bitcoin side chain. Developments such as Taproot and <a target="_blank" href="https://judica.org/blog/sapio-tutorial/">Sapio</a> also enable more functionality for Bitcoin at lower levels.<br></p><h2>Come Build with Us<br></h2><p>This is just the beginning of an entire open financial world being created around Bitcoin. We’re planning to do further posts on Bitcoin DeFi, so look out for additional posts to come.

      name: "Hiro UX Team - July 2021 Recap",
      "post-body":
        '<p>July was another productive month for the UX team, with our main focus being on introducing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/microblocks-reduce-transaction-processing-times">Microblocks</a> to both Stacks Wallets and the Stacks Explorer. This is one of the most anticipated features for Stacks 2.0 that allows transaction to process in just seconds instead of the typical ~10 minute confirmation time on the Bitcoin blockchain. We are looking to ship an initial implementation during the first half of August 🤞 and we will share more updates on Microblocks very soon.</p><p>But wait, there’s more! We’ve deployed improvements to our state management, improved our Ledger implementation, designed a new onboarding flow, and during the monthly hackathon we increased our test coverage by a lot!</p><p>‍</p><h2>✅ Second team hackathon: Shipping fast, often, and with confidence</h2><p>As you may recall from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/hiro-ux-team-june-2021-recap">previous team updates</a>, the UX team runs a hackathon every single month with the goal of using the products we build. This month was an exception since we decided to take the three days to focus solely on improving the test coverage of Hiro’s web wallet.<br></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/brjavaman">Bruno Souza</a>, one of the greatest Java engineers of all time, said that writing tests is like wearing a seat belt. If you want to drive really fast, you’ll want to wear more and better seat belts!<br></p><p>Moving fast allows us to be nimble: ship more often, iterate quickly, and since the wallet deals with highly sensitive data, deliver a high quality product safely and with confidence.</p><h3>What was the result?</h3><p>Unit tests went from 5% to more than 40% coverage, and there are now functional tests for almost all critical flows.<br></p><p>This is an ongoing process and we keep improving and adding tests as we ship code.</p><p>‍</p><h2>🚀 Microblocks and more!</h2><p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/microblocks">Microblocks</a> is a feature that impacts three projects that the team owns: the Stacks Explorer and two Stacks Wallets, but the bulk of the work has been done on the Explorer and web version of the wallet in particular.<br></p><p>In this first implementation, the web wallet will show in the activity feed both the anchor and microblock balances, with the anchor one being more prominent. If a transaction is in a microblock, it will show a new “lightning bolt” icon.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:3232px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="3232px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/610b9869cae35f71e1cfc2a6_VjeijKf4.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>The explorer will inform whether a transaction has been included in a microblock or an anchor block, with icons and legend in the activity feed.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2880px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2880px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/610b98b7e26a776a2d046e88_TLANgtG5.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>While working on the Explorer, we took the opportunity to leave the place better than we found it by making several code improvements, including an update to the state management.</p><p>Even though the new experience for users seems simple, this has been a large engineering and design undertaking, iterating to deeply understand how the API behaves and thoroughly testing different use-cases. &nbsp;These efforts helped us improve <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/microblocks#best-practices">the guidance we provide to developers</a>.</p><h3>Desktop wallet Ledger updates</h3><p>We have been working closely with the Ledger team on an update to remove the “developer mode” status of Stacks app for Ledger that will soon see the light of day. We have only one change to make then we’ll resubmit the app for re-review with an expectation for approval soon.</p><h3>Onboarding</h3><p>During July we worked on, perhaps, one of the most critical aspects of the Stacks UX: the onboarding experience.<br></p><p>The Stacks Wallet is the gateway to the Stacks ecosystem. Having a good onboarding experience that gives users a sense of what they’ll need to do in order to interact with an application is fundamental to building confidence and trust, directly impacting the overall conversion and retention rates for the ecosystem.<br></p><p>In this new iteration, we’ve explored the idea of helping users find apps, register names, buy STX and back up their Secret Key. Here is a preview:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2800px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/610b98fa4f911ba853f0d696_UYo3Ig05.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>We only have one chance to get a good first impression, and what we say and do can be the difference between having users feeling lost or welcome to our community.</p><p>‍</p><h2>🏅 Would you like to join the team?</h2><p>Hiro’s UX team is, without a doubt, the most amazing team I’ve ever belonged to. Full of kind, proactive people that deeply care for the community we belong to, the product we build, and most importantly for each other.<br></p><p>We are looking for a Front End Engineer to help us create an inspiring, compassionate, and productive team that makes a name for itself in the crypto space!<br></p><p>If you want to spend your days working in a fully open source and remote environment, alongside the most brilliant minds in the crypto industry, <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/hiro/84199390-2d9a-4a7e-9db4-4d6ceddd8d38" target="_blank">please apply here</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2>🗓️ August plans </h2><p>During August the priority is to ship a first iteration of microblocks. We’ll also be kickstarting the work to implement a new and amazing onboarding.</p><p>‍</p><h2>📺 July’s UX Team demos</h2><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/OFXhy8g5LcI"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFXhy8g5LcI"></iframe></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/iZi3q3nnpes"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iZi3q3nnpes"></iframe></div></figure>',

        '<p>Shameless Plug: Matt’s a cool person and we’re looking for someone to work directly with him on our developer tools: SDKs, Libraries, APIs. He wants folks to know that he ported all of our JavaScript developer library, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js">Stacks.JS</a> to TypeScript now. :)&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“This could use more attention and it would be great to work with someone on this and the API.”<br></blockquote><p>Matt is currently working out of Tulum, Mexico after his wedding this past summer in Idaho. His regular residence is in Amsterdam, Netherlands where Hiro has an office. He permanently relocated there just weeks before the world shut down from Covid (Feb 2020). Before that, he lived in New York City, moving there for the <a target="_blank" href="https://jobs.lever.co/hiro/fd82651d-0d68-41ad-8d42-7dafe5333822">Developer Tools Software Engineer</a> position at Hiro. </p><p>‍</p><h3><strong><em>— How did you end up here? Amsterdam and Hiro and all?</em></strong></h3><p>I grew up in Boise, Idaho and went to the University of Idaho. After the first year, I got an internship at CBS close to New York City, so I drove there with my girlfriend, two cats, and all of our stuff. After the internship, I told my boss at the time that I didn’t want to go back to school, and he hired me as a contractor. <br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:350px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatleft" data-rt-max-width="350px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/6103c63a2d4ec20cdf785c93_0VQtr3Nw.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>During that time, around 2010, I was working on an “appointment-booker” app I developed as a side project to help my mom’s nail salon not lose so much money with cancellations. It was getting tons of downloads! When a co-worker friend said we could start charging and making money off of it, all three of us moved back to Idaho to my parent’s basement to work on it. After the first month, we were actually getting recurring revenue of around $1,000 per month! Unfortunately, I then broke my arm and couldn’t work for several months. Our database was also having global locking issues so we had to shutdown that startup. <br></p><p>After that, I got a regular software engineering job in Boise. This was around 2014, and I became interested in crypto and the technology behind it. I started doing some work for a mining pool and realized how hard it was to set up a pool at the time and I wanted to make it easier for people. So, I made a software called NOMP - Node.js Opensource Mining Pool as a side project. It became really popular and people started reaching out to me to help them build stuff, like one of the first mining pools for Monero. That software was my first contribution to decentralization. <br></p><p>Fast forward some years later, in 2017 during the crypto boom, someone who had exposure to my work for the open source community approached me with a job offer to get paid working on crypto full time. I was game! So I moved down to Las Vegas with my now wife Kinley to work on an Ethereum smart contract auditing system. Business was<strong> so </strong>good during the crypto boom, until it wasn’t anymore. The company went from extremely profitable to bankrupt in 2 weeks. We went from huge parties at casinos, to “alright guys we’re shutting down, this is your last paycheck.“</p><h3><strong><em>— Eeek, sorry to hear, then what did you do? </em></strong></h3><p>I didn’t care that much because I know it’s easy for software engineers to find jobs. I played video games for a few weeks, then got bored and found Hiro (formerly Blockstack) on AngelList. I was talking to other companies at the time, even other YC companies. But I had the best interviewing experience at Hiro, got to meet awesome people like <a target="_blank" href="https://aaron.blankstein.com/">Aaron</a>, and the company seems super legit. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginaabrams/">Gina</a> made it happen quick! Like in 2 weeks. I could have worked remotely at the time but I didn’t want to live in Idaho or Las Vegas anymore, so we picked up and moved to New York! Hiro provided a relocation bonus as well, so met the team, and went on to my first retreat shortly after. I will never forget having beers with everyone and playing mafia until late at night.</p><h3><strong><em>— Ok, so how did you end up in Amsterdam? </em></strong></h3><p>After my last crypto company went out of business, my partner talked about having kids and the Netherlands looked like a good place, and relatively easy to get a long term visa. </p><p>After I started the job at Hiro and moved to NYC, I found out we already had some team members in the Netherlands, and other team members also wanted to move there. It was super awesome that Hiro took care of all the paperwork and created a Dutch Entity and made it <strong>way</strong> easier for me to move there. </p><p>It was also really crazy timing that it all lined up and I got into the Netherlands and got my Dutch residency card the day right after they announced Covid closures and people were cleaning the office and closing it down. </p><h3><strong><em>— Why Hiro for you? </em></strong></h3><p>I like working with the people here. There’s no one that I don’t like. I want to work in the crypto space, and other companies are either not interesting (like I don’t want to work for a traditional company that wants to branch into crypto). There are other companies similar to Hiro, but to me they have less funding, aren’t as further along in development, or their investors are not as impressive to me. I also like the flexibility of working for a small company like Hiro, and the versatile working hours and locations. <em>(Author’s note: Hiro provides many </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/careers"><em>perks and benefits</em></a><em> in addition to a generous STX package, such as flexible vacation policy, co-working space and daily lunch stipend for all employees, including remote, benefits matching and more).</em></p><h3><strong><em>— What do you look forward to doing everyday? Not just here, but in any job. </em></strong></h3><p>I like it when there’s a feature or bug that I can work on and ship that day. Those are good days, happy days. Especially if it’s a long big project that took a while to get there. I really enjoy projects that takes time and I get to ship the finish version. </p><p>I also really like collaborating with other people on projects, but there’s not a lot of that right now because I’m the only person working on it. We need more people to join so I can work with them! </p><h3><strong><em>— Ok, last question: If you have to choose: Lambo or Yacht or private jet? </em></strong></h3><p>I would want a private jet but I heard it’s terrible for the environment so I think I would feel bad. I prefer a Tesla over a Lambo. A yacht doesn’t seem that interesting to me. &nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1079px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1079px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61001f37d9b8a89b4411a7bd_Asset%2028.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h5>To work with Matt on developer tooling, or check out any other roles, visit our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/careers">career page</a>.

        '<p>Since the launch of Stacks 2.0 in January, developers have embraced and explored the world of <a target="_blank" href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a>.</p>',
      "post-body":
        '<p>They enjoy building smart contracts in a familiar, LISP-based language that makes use of a strong static type system and puts a premium on security. Clarity also removes the multitude of frustrations that are introduced with a turing-complete smart contract language like Ethereum’s Solidity. Now that the Stacks developer community is hitting its stride and maturing quickly, we’re beginning to see patterns emerge like best practices, optimal smart contract structure, common design choices, and most frequently used functions &amp; keywords. The <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-keywords">keywords</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions">functions</a> in Clarity are the language’s fundamental building blocks, and perform the mechanisms needed to manipulate data and value on the blockchain. <br></p><p>To help developers get started building smart contracts with Clarity more easily, we’ve compiled a list of the most useful and popular Clarity keywords and functions. To do this, we used the API from <a target="_blank" href="https://search-clarity.dev/">Clarity Search</a>, a search engine used to display the source code of any and all smart contracts have been deployed successfully on Stacks mainnet. It’s a helpful tool for developers that want to browse Clarity examples built by other developers in the community. <br></p><p>Our findings included these five essentials: <strong>tx-sender, block-height, define-trait </strong>&amp;<strong> impl-trait, define-map, </strong>and<strong> define-constant</strong>.</p><h2>tx-sender</h2><p>tx-sender is far and away the most frequently used Clarity keyword in the language. It’s a global keyword that takes no input, but when used in a Clarity smart contract, tx-sender will output a principal. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/principals">Principals</a> are a Clarity native type that represents an entity that can have a token balance. There are two types of principals on Stacks: hashed wallet addresses (secured by public/private key) on the blockchain that can send transactions, and Clarity smart contracts living on the network (no private key, cannot send transactions). Therefore, whenever tx-sender is used within a smart contract, it will instantiate that variable with the identifier value associated with the address that originally called the contract. On Stacks, wallet addresses and principals are represented by a string of 40 alphanumeric characters. (For example: STJRM2AMVF90ER6G3RW1QTF85E3HZH37006D5ER1)<br></p><p>For more context, Stacks addresses are based on three components: a prefix (S), a version byte describing the type of address (T = testnet, P = mainnet, M = multisig mainnet, N = multisig testnet), and the rest is a hash160 of the public key, represented as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#Crockford\'s_Base32">Crockford Base32</a> string.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:673.5px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="673.5px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60fadacbeef72710de29e67d_RLjVm7Mg.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Using tx-sender to obtain a principle to transfer STX from</figcaption></figure><p>In this basic example, the person calling this contract is attempting to transfer an amount of STX from their own address to a friend’s wallet. The stx-transfer function is invoked, and three logical arguments are required: the amount, the principal sending the STX, and the address that should receive the tokens. It would be inefficient and potentially dangerous to manually enter an address into the contract. It’s an extremely long string of characters that could be easily misspelled, and it would also destroy the public reusability of the contract by eliminating abstraction. By using the tx-sender keyword, the Clarity contract can automatically “autofill” the tx-sender variable with the address of the principal calling the contract. That way the blockchain knows exactly where to withdraw funds from to complete the desired mechanism of the transaction. <br></p><p>tx-sender may seem like a rudimentary way to achieve attribution in smart contracts, but it is an integral building block for any decentralized operation. Think of it almost as the “From” field in an email. tx-sender is a reliable and accessible way to get principals into Clarity smart contracts.</p><h2>block-height</h2><p>Another critical keyword in any Clarity developers toolbox is <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-keywords#block-height">block-height</a>. Sometimes it’s useful to have statistics about the blockchain’s operation injected into a smart contract. Blockchains at their core are state machines, and it can be valuable to have a variable that keeps track of the most recent state verified by miners. To solve this problem, using block-height in Clarity will return a uint value representing the current block height of the Stacks blockchain.<br></p><p>It can also be used as an estimator of time. Since blockchains are such secure computer science systems, it can be difficult to get certain real-world information into the network. Handling specific times and durations can be problematic because blockchains don’t have a native, internal clock. Therefore, predictable block numbers and the consistent pending time between them can be used as helpful relative trackers of time elapsing. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:621px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="621px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60fadc6a6e7df6d917f811bd_D8-e8kWQ.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>A miner registry using block-height</figcaption></figure><p>The above example is a nifty Clarity contract for creating a <a target="_blank" href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0x87ee15851740b3e545ca6296b5f452ac81bf686051b0fdf271451423a5b58051?chain=mainnet">registry of miners</a> who have successfully mined a block on the Stacks network. To do so, this developer created a simple map that tracks each new block number, and the principal of the miner that received the block reward. This is super useful functionality for maintaining a living archive and historical record of mining on Stacks. Logically, this map simply needs a tuple of the winning miners principal, and a uint of the associated block number. Using block-height to obtain data about the most recently mined block is an easy and lightweight method to grab important metrics quickly, and add time-based prerequisites to particular operations in a contract.</p><h2>define-trait and impl-trait </h2><p>If the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Vhh_GeBPOhs">classic video</a> of Steve Ballmer was to be recreated today for the blockchain industry, I think he would instead be cheering for “Interoperability! Interoperability! Interoperability!”</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60fadd1092780bc8a16e77db_6Nr2Z_Ed.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Blockchain is still an extremely nascent technology in the experimentation phase. There are thousands of different teams working on pushing the limits of the tech, but it’s important that standards are reached to allow disconnected smart contracts and tokens to, for lack of a better term, “play nice” together. You saw the same type of interoperability emerge in the early internet. HTTP, Bluetooth, RSS, XML, even specific filetypes like .PDF were all efforts to allow different pieces of hardware and software to share a common lexicon.<br></p><p>The trait system in Clarity is a mechanism that allows for simple definition and configuration of a common interface. The <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#define-trait">define-trait</a> function outlines the necessary name, functions, argument types, and return type required for a contract to be considered an implementation of the trait. This then allows independent smart contracts to trust that there are a common set of features between them. Once a trait is defined and publicly deployed to the blockchain, a simple <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#impl-trait">impl-trait</a> invocation will signal to the network that a smart contract is indeed implementing a preexisting trait’s features. &nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:621px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="621px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60faddeed3d38e5cb8179cd5_z-rt8AUQ.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>The NFT trait definition in Clarity, and the four functions it must implement to conform to the standard</figcaption></figure><p>A perfect example of traits in action would be the recent <a target="_blank" href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0xe547bca01878eaaf4758a067d3f522691a8928fcade0b0a4930a825c10d082bc?chain=mainnet">non-fungible (NFT) token trait</a> deployed onto the Stacks network. During the testnet era, various <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/radicleart/clarity-hackathon-level1/blob/master/contracts/nongibles.clar">NFT experiments</a> were popping up in the explorer and on Github as devs wanted to test out the expressive functionality of Clarity. However, a community-accepted, formalized NFT standard had not been established yet. This resulted in all of the NFTs implementing their own specialized, nuanced methods and functions to achieve NFT functionality. Everything changed when the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/friedger-main/sips/sip-009/sip-009-nft-standard.md">NFT trait</a> was developed by the community and deployed accessibly to the network! Now, as seen above, there are four distinct methods that a smart contract <strong>must </strong>contain to be considered a standard-conforming NFT on Stacks. Those methods allow the contract to set an original owner, connect metadata, check the last NFT registered, or transfer ownership.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:764px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="764px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60fade11161b986c50b30a98_t78qVSHg.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>A Clarity smart contract implementing the NFT trait</figcaption></figure><p>Once a trait is defined, and a developer wants to implement it into their new smart contract, it is merely a single line of code at the top of a contract that signals its adherence to the NFT trait. The above contract is the recreation of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.christies.com/features/Monumental-collage-by-Beeple-is-first-purely-digital-artwork-NFT-to-come-to-auction-11510-7.aspx">Beeple NFT</a> on the Stacks blockchain. All the creator of this contract had to do was use the function impl-trait, followed by a trait identifier containing the principal of the contract that defined the trait. Once a trait is implemented, that contract is then expected to contain the four required methods we mentioned before that allow NFTs to function correctly. It also allows NFT metadata to be displayed in products like wallets or the explorer. Take a look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0x8f0393265a8a4102701ef6240b03022c567cf67f04e472e077709fe975424921?chain=mainnet">beeple.clar</a> contract in the explorer to investigate the source code and trait implementation yourself!</p><h2>define-map</h2><p>When it comes to programming languages, data structures are integral for handling and manipulating sets of information. You might be familiar with arrays, lists, trees, graphs, tables, sets, and other data structures for storing information. In Clarity, <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#define-map">maps</a> are used to keep track of the location of specific data in memory. They’re a simple but effective way to relate two sets of information. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:702.5px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="702.5px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60fade3e4097c4bd811dc08d_osff4DVw.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Defining a map to hold strings containing quotes submitted by users</figcaption></figure><p>In the above example, a developer deployed a contract to the Stacks blockchain in an effort to maintain a library of quotes submitted by users. To add a quote to the library, an individual just needs to call the contract’s add-quote method and pass in a string of their choosing. How are these quotes and their associated identifiers stored? A map is defined as a data structure to catalogue the quote’s string, and an arbitrary incrementing ID. Whenever a new quote is added, it is appended to the map using the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#map-insert">map-insert</a> function. Due to the state of the map living on the blockchain in the smart contract, any user can then call the get-quote-by-id method, pass in a quote’s identifier, and receive the quote associated with that ID thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#map-get">map-get</a> function. </p><p>While a map may seem like a simple list of tuples, it actually unlocks loads of unique functionality that is valuable to developers. Being able to conveniently store and recall data in an organized fashion will be critical for more robust contracts serving a multitude of users. </p><h2>define-constant</h2><p><a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions#define-constant">define-constant </a>is one of the most frequently used functions in the Clarity reference, and it’s because of its versatility. Sometimes, as a developer you need some persistent, global variables to perform necessary functionality throughout a contract. The safest and most organized method to achieve this is by instantiating constant variables in your Clarity contract using the define-constant function. The expression passed into the definition is evaluated at contract launch, in the order that it is supplied in the contract. Similar to other kinds of definition statements, define-constant may only be used outside of other functions. You cannot put a define-constant statement in the middle of a function body, as then it would not be globally accessible.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:621px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="621px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60fadedc4097c4c8bb1dc6c9_sRvvnZfg.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Boomboxes smart contract defining constant variables</figcaption></figure><p>One Clarity smart contract that implemented constants particularly well was <a target="_blank" href="https://boom.money/">Boom.Money</a>’s new Stacking NFT: <a target="_blank" href="https://boom-wallet.medium.com/how-to-get-your-first-boombox-d97a9404e759">Boomboxes</a>. This is an extremely complex piece of software that is handling cryptocurrency, interacting with Stacks’ core consensus mechanism, and keeping track of the length of various stacking cycles. A handful of global constants were required to achieve the Boombox mechanism. <br></p><p>It defines a constant dplyr, and assigns tx-sender to it. From earlier, we know that tx-sender is simply the address of the user that deployed the contract. This developer might have need for their personal address later in the contract (to allow contract calls for example). Using define-constant to instantiate a principal as a global variable is a quick and easy way to use it throughout various methods. <br></p><p>It also sets the minimum amount of STX someone needs to participate using define-constant. By instantiating minimum-amount to 100000000 uSTX, this developer could then plug that variable in anywhere within the contract for quick input validation. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:400px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatleft" data-rt-max-width="400px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60fadf161564c0530f51b764_wJLk6DIR.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>The most intriguing use of define-constant here though is how it helps establish a sense of time passing in the smart contract. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stacks.co/stacking">Stacking</a> on the Stacks blockchain is done in <a target="_blank" href="https://stacking.club/cycles/current">cycles</a>, with one stacking cycle lasting approximately ~2,100 Bitcoin blocks or 15 real-world days. Therefore, it is important for this smart contract to be able to discern when a particular cycle has started, is in-progress, or has concluded. First, this developer assigns the time-limit constant a value of u690950. This actually has nothing to do with seconds or minutes, but is the precise Bitcoin block number that the stacking cycle will begin and Stackers must contribute their STX by. Then, when this contract is called to begin disburse NFTs, it checks that the current block height is less than block number defined in time-limit. This is a roundabout, but genius, way of figuring out when a specific time has passed in the real world. </p><p>As demonstrated by this contract, defining constants at the start of your contract can be a superpower. This developer instantiated five tactful constant, and then proceeded to use them efficiently and effectively throughout the Clarity contract. Think of them as your friendly, global variables when developing software for Stacks.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1079px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1079px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/61001f37d9b8a89b4411a7bd_Asset%2028.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>These were just a handful of the weapons in your <a target="_blank" href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a> arsenal that show how truly flexible and customizable the language can be There are numerous <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-types">types</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-keywords">keywords</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/language-functions">functions</a> in Clarity, all performing their own important operations.

      name: "Clarinet: Taking Clarity Development to the Next Level",
      "post-body":
        '<h1>How it all began</h1><p>Since the release of Stacks 2.0 in January, and the Clarity smart contracting language, writing and testing contracts has been difficult. The best testing framework available was <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/clarity-js-sdk">ClarityJS SDK</a> — a TypeScript library that provided access to the Clarity runtime. However, the library was cumbersome to use. Even simple things required workarounds and a great deal of boilerplate code. Troubleshooting was difficult, and the chain-state was only hardly observable. <br></p><p>With that being said, there were some other promising projects in the Stacks ecosystem: The language-server-protocol used in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/clarity-vscode-extension">VSCode Extension for Clarity</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-repl">Clarity REPL</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarity-jupyter-kernel">Jupyter kernel</a> to run Clarity code. However, they were all separate projects and hardly accessible for a beginner Clarity developer. As a result, an idea was born: <em>What if there was a single CLI that would enable a productive flow - similar to the experience </em><a target="_blank" href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html"><em>Rails</em></a><em> is providing?</em><br></p><p>A few cycles later, and we released the first proof of concept. Codename: <strong>Clarinet</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><h1>A CLI package including a Clarity runtime, REPL, and testing harness </h1><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:896px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="896px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60f830457e1d2874ea8ab81b_demo.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Clarinet is our new go-to tool for local Clarity smart contract development. It is designed to facilitate rapid smart contract development, testing, and deployment. It consists of a Clarity REPL and a testing harness. These elements used in tandem allow you to rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, without the need to deploy the contract to a local mocknet or testnet.<br></p><p>What does this mean in practice? Let’s take a look at the key capabilities…<br></p><h3>Creating new projects and adding contracts</h3><p>Clarinet can create a folder structure and automatically organize configuration files to control your testing environment. The settings define available networks, associated accounts, token balances, and contracts to load before tests would be executed. You can even define contract dependencies!</p><h6># create a new project called my-project<br>clarinet new my-project<br><br># create a new contract called bbtc<br>clarinet contract new bbtc</h6><p>Once your project is set up, you are only one command away from a new contract. It will create a new file for the contract as well as a boilerplate test-suite. Test-driven development couldn’t come any easier.<br></p><h3>Writing tests</h3><p>Clarinet comes with a TypeScript package for easy interactions with the Clarity runtime. It exposes objects to read and update the the chain, individual accounts, and contracts. To simplify contract interactions, the package also includes Clarity type support. Last but not least, the package includes an assert module, so you can define expected results and make assertions.</p><p>Here is a small, working test example for illustration purposes:</p><div></div><p><br></p><h3>Checking Clarity syntax</h3><p>While you’re developing your contract, you will likely want to check if your contract is syntactically correct. Every contract configured in the project can be checked with a single command.</p><h6># check contract syntax<br>clarinet check</h6><h3>Running tests and measuring code coverage</h3><p>You can run defined tests and see results in your terminal.</p><h6># run tests<br>clarinet test</h6><p>You can even configure GitHub actions to run your tests automatically once you check-in your updates in a Github repository. Here is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/arkadiko-dao/arkadiko/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-clarinet.yml">an example from the Arkadiko project</a>.</p><h3>Interacting with contracts</h3><p>Clarinet comes with an interactive console that can be used to interact with a Clarity runtime. As you would expect, all configured accounts and contracts will be available for usage. Once loaded, you will see a snapshot of the available contracts and accounts. This is a great way to experiment with the Clarity language.</p><h6># start REPL<br>clarinet console<br>‍<br># call the sai-hi method of the hello-worls contract<br>&gt; (contract-call? .hello-world say-hi)</h6><h3><strong>Deploying contracts to mocknet</strong></h3><p>Once you reach a high-enough confidence level of your implementation, you can use Clarinet to deploy your contracts to a mocknet. This way, you can start integrating the contract inside your app without repetitive, manual steps.</p><h6># deploy all contracts to mocknet<br>clarinet deploy --mocknet</h6><h3><em>Coming soon: Integrate contracts in your apps</em></h3><p>A little sneak peek for a feature currently in the works. A new command will make it easy for developers to spin up a local developer network with their contracts deployed. With that, developers can integrate contracts within their apps much quicker. Stay tuned for more!</p><p>‍</p><h1>Give it a try and let us know what you think</h1><p>With Clarinet becoming the new go-to tool for local Clarity smart contract development, we updated the documentation.

        "Learn about how blockchain software efficiently represents, queries, and authenticates data.",
      name: "Under the Hood: Efficient Storage for Fork-Aware Blockchains",
      "post-body":
        '<p>The analogy of a blockchain to a distributed ledger is a common one. First, blockchain miners compete to win a leader election. On becoming a leader, the miner packages transactions into a block, which they can then append to any previous block. Other participants in the network receive the block, and can verify if the transactions are valid as compared to their local copy of the ledger (for example, they can ensure Alice doesn’t send more cryptocurrency than she owns to Bob). <br></p><p>What might be unclear, however, is exactly how blockchain software <em>efficiently</em> keeps track of and queries data. For example, Alice may transfer a token to Bob at a block height of 400. If Bob wants to transfer that token to Charlie at a block height of 10000, the blockchain must be able to quickly determine (and verify) whether Bob owns that token in order to verify that transaction. It also must be possible to efficiently query state in different forks, each of which may have different transactions. This article will provide a high-level overview of what is happening under the hood to enable this efficient querying in the Stacks blockchain. <br></p><p>If you are curious about the internal workings of the blockchain, read on! After reading this post, you will understand what properties the view of the global state must have for the blockchain to operate efficiently and correctly.</p><p>‍</p><h1>Blockchains &amp; state </h1><p>As we just discussed, a blockchain is a series of blocks, containing transactions. Let’s call the final state of all data — accounts, balances, assets —“global state”, which is the end result of applying those transactions in a particular order. The materialized view is a snapshot of this global state at a particular block in the blockchain. Blockchain software needs to query the materialized view in its operation. Some examples of queries are validating transactions and checking the current value of a field. <br></p><p>Blockchains must support special properties that traditional databases do not. They must be able to support conflicting transaction histories (forks), as well as be able to authenticate any state on any fork. </p><p>‍</p><h1>What is a materialized view?</h1><p>To reiterate, a materialized view is a snapshot of the state of the blockchain at a particular chain tip - it is the state of the world having applied all the transactions. In the Stacks blockchain, this data is represented as a simple key-value store. Examples of the type of data that would be stored are the total supply of a particular fungible token, or a mapping from a block height to the hash of the block at that height. To understand why we should care about the materialized view, let’s discuss what properties were most important during the design process. </p><h3>1. Needs to be authenticated </h3><p>We should be able to prove that a key corresponds to a certain value in a given fork, and the proof should be short. &nbsp;To explain the general idea behind this, let’s describe a system to authenticate a singular key value pair. Instead of storing the value directly (since that could be space-intensive), our system would instead map a hash of the key to a hash of the value, which is generated by feeding the key (and value) through a hashing function, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms">SHA256</a>. A client could then verify they have the correct value locally by applying the same hash function, and comparing the hash they obtain to the hash the system stores at the key hash. </p><p>With this property, a client with a singular known-good block hash would be able to verify all key-value pairs at that block. </p><h3>2. Able to cheaply handle multiple forks</h3><p>Forks in blockchains are common, and each will have a different materialized view (this is because each fork may have different transactions, leading to a different blockchain state). Moreover, at any given point, a miner can build a block off of <em>any</em> previous block in the blockchain. We must be able to cheaply generate the materialized view for any new block as well as for any new fork. If we did not have this property, a bad actor could attempt to mine blocks in “unfavorable” forks (forks that take longer to process than average). This could lead to a denial-of-service attack, due to higher block processing times. </p><h3>3. Adding new data should be cheap</h3><p>Adding new data (aka, new key-value pairs) to the materialized view must be cheap. In other words, processing block number 10000000 should be just as cheap as processing block 1. </p><h3>4. Needs to be history-dependent </h3><p>The materialized view needs to be deterministic, or history dependent. Switching the order of block N and block M anywhere in the blockchain’s history should yield a different final state. In practice, doing this would lead to a different final block header hash. </p><p><br></p><h1>The structure of the materialized view </h1><p>As I said before, the materialized view is represented by a simple key-value store. There are two components to this storage: </p><ul><li>The first component is the raw data itself, which can be stored in any data store or database. This component would store the actual key and value. </li><li>The second component is the authenticated index, for which we use the Merkelized Adaptive Radix Forest (MARF) data structure. The MARF is responsible for linking hashes of keys to a hash of the corresponding value in a way that allows us to cryptographically prove that a specific key maps to a specific value at a particular block in a particular fork. This data structure doesn’t store the raw data, but rather hashes of that data. It allows us to efficiently query and authenticate blockchain state. The MARF achieves each of the design goals laid out in the section above.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>A blockchain is a peer-to-peer database. The materialized view is a snapshot of that database at a specific block, and it allows us to efficiently represent, query, and authenticate state. In contrast to conventional databases, the materialized view of a blockchain needs to handle conflicting histories efficiently (aka forks), and be able to authenticate key-value pairs.

For app developers and users alike, this means that Stacks accounts can be referenced with unique, user-owned, and human-readable usernames. This blog posts shed light on the current status of the BNS support in Hiro tooling, like stacks.js packages and the Stacks Wallet.

        '<h2>BNS on Clarity</h2><p><a href="https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/0xd8a9a4528ae833e1894eee676af8d218f8facbf95e166472df2c1a64219b5dfb?chain=mainnet" target="_blank">BNS support</a> was added to the Stacks blockchain with the release of Stacks 2.0. Just like Stacking, BNS is implemented through the Clarity smart contracting language itself. The BNS contract provides a set of <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/bns-contract" target="_blank">public and read-only methods</a> to interact with the naming system.<br></p><h2>Users can register usernames</h2><p>Stacks users can interact with the BNS contract to register usernames (e.g. alex.id.stx) for any number of available namespaces such as .id.stx. Name registrars can also interact with the contract to add new namespaces, which are similar to top-level domains in the traditional Domain Name System (DNS).<br></p><p>For instance, the recently launched <a target="_blank" href="https://btc.us/">BTC.us</a> service enables users to create .btc usernames such as muneeb.btc. Users have to pay with STX for username operations, as defined by the rules of the namespace owner. <br></p><p>Unlike with other authenticators previously released by Hiro (such as Blockstack Connect or the Blockstack Browser), users cannot register usernames for <em>free</em> using the newer <a href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web" target="_blank">Stacks Web Wallet</a> browser extension. They will need to pay a registration and transaction fee using STX, and use an app that integrates registration via BNS smart contract calls like <a target="_blank" href="https://btc.us">BTC.us</a>.<br></p><p>However, the extension does <em>show</em> free usernames that were registered previously, and we’re considering the reintroduction of free username registration to the Stacks Wallet as a future enhancement.</p><p>To access your previously registered usernames, simply sign into the browser extension with the same underlying Secret Key (previously known as “Secret Recovery Key”) that you used before to manage them.<br></p><h2>Developers can use a BNS package and the API to integrate name operations</h2><p>Developers can leverage the <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/bns" target="_blank">BNS package</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api" target="_blank">API</a> to:</p><ul><li>Fetch or register namespaces (for instance .id)</li><li>Fetch or register usernames for a specific namespace (for instance alex.id)</li><li>Fetch all username details (for instance Stacks address or expiration date)</li><li>Fetch the history of name operations for a specific username</li><li>Fetch all available subdomains (for instance personal.id)<br></li></ul><p>With BNS tooling, developers can build full-featured naming capabilities inside their apps. For example, apps could enable interaction with other users by username - sending tokens from one account to another with human-readable addresses. Apps could also display the username instead of the account address in their app - this will help users recognize that they are using the right account for. These are only a few examples! We cannot wait to see developers using the naming system to build better user experiences on the user-owned internet.<br></p><h2>Getting started</h2><p>We are currently working on more advanced documentation for BNS. In the meantime, there are several resources to help you get started today:<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/bns" target="_blank">Learn more about BNS and how it works</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/example-apps/heystack#reading-bns-names" target="_blank">For React apps: Sample code for reading usernames inside your app</a></li><li><a href="https://stacks-js-git-master-blockstack.vercel.app/modules/bns.html" target="_blank">For name operations in JS: Review the BNS JS library references</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.stacks.co/references/bns-contract" target="_blank">For Clarity contracts: Review the BNS contract references</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api" target="_blank">For direct API usage: Review the BNS API endpoints</a></li></ul><p>‍</p>',

        '<p>I’m <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-gray-28b2163a/">Patrick Gray</a>, the Docs Lead at Hiro. I joined the company at the beginning of May, and have been working to get up to speed on the Stacks documentation over the last couple months. I have been a technical writer for 9 years, and I’ve worked in a variety of different industries. Most recently, I was doing product documentation for map production software in the self-driving car industry. I came to Hiro because I’m interested in the crypto world, and I’m excited about the Stacks vision of a decentralized internet secured by the computing power of Bitcoin. I am here to take Stacks developer documentation to the next level.</p><p>In addition to helping improve the documentation, I’ll be providing regular updates through the Stacks blog and other channels to help promote the documentation content and drive community contribution. I have lots of ideas that I’m excited to share with you!<br></p><p>This is a recap of the documentation changes that landed in Q2, and a quick preview of planned content for Q3.</p><p>‍</p><h1>🔮 Clarity content</h1><p>Smart contracts on Stacks make all sorts of amazing products possible. Due to Stacks having native visibility into Bitcoin state, projects built on Stacks can leverage the huge amounts of capital already locked into the Bitcoin ecosystem.<br></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity</a> is the native language of smart contracts on Stacks. Helping new developers learn the language and take their first steps into developing smart contracts with Clarity is key to growing a thriving ecosystem. The documentation helps new developers through a series of tutorials and examples, which we have been working to expand throughout Q2. Additionally, Hiro released <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet">Clarinet</a>, a powerful development tool for Clarity smart contracts.</p><h2>Clarinet</h2><p>Clarinet is a local development tool that helps you quickly develop and test smart contracts on your development machine, without the need to deploy the contract to a live blockchain. Clarinet is helpful because it allows you to quickly iterate on Clarity smart contracts. Clarinet consists of a Clarity syntax checker for validating your contract, a local read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) for interactive testing, and a Typescript testing harness for writing automated unit tests. Additionally, Clarinet has been integrated with Github actions for code coverage testing at PR time.</p><p>In Q2, we added a comprehensive overview of Clarinet to the Stacks documentation. This overview includes installation instructions, and examples of common uses of Clarinet for local Clarity development.</p><p>Clarinet is very actively developed, and new features are being added regularly. You can help get Clarinet included in your OS package manager by going to the Clarinet repository and clicking the ⭐ ️and <strong>Watch</strong> buttons in the upper right of the repository page.<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/smart-contracts/clarinet" target="_blank">Clarinet overview in the Stacks documentation</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet">Clarinet repository</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/YWa8BmKqvR">#clarinet in the Stacks Discord</a></li></ul><h2>Tutorial updates</h2><p>At the beginning of Q2, Stacks documentation had two beginner Clarity tutorials. In order to get new developers working as quickly as possible, these tutorials used a Gitpod environment in browser. Additionally, the tutorials relied on the Stacks CLI and the live testnet environment to deploy and test the tutorial contracts. While the live deployment was a useful skill to build, the reliance on the live <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/testnet">testnet</a> often meant that a basic tutorial could take over an hour to complete.</p><p>To improve developer experience, and to promote use of the Clarinet development environment, the two beginner tutorials were re-written to use Clarinet. This allows the tutorials to be completed quickly, and leaves the beginner developer with a working development environment. Each tutorial includes an optional step to deploy the contract to the testnet, so developers looking to build that skill can continue to exercise it, without the deployment time being a learning impediment.</p><p>Now the beginner tutorials focus primarily on skills new developers need for long term success: a working development environment, familiarity with Clarity’s LISP syntax and how to validate it, and rapid iteration on in-development code. We maintained training on how to deploy contracts to the blockchain, while emphasizing a great foundation for taking the next steps into Clarity.<br></p><h2>New Billboard tutorial</h2><p>A big new addition to the documentation in Q2 was the Billboard tutorial, an intermediate tutorial that demonstrates additional features of Clarity. This tutorial came from workshop material developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/reedrosenbluth?lang=en">Reed Rosenbluth</a> of the Stacks Platform team at Hiro for the <a target="_blank" href="https://stacks.ac/">Stacks Accelerator</a> teams Tech Week.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/zERDftjl6k8"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zERDftjl6k8"></iframe></div></figure><p>The Billboard tutorial is an example smart contract that stores a UTF-8 string on the blockchain (the billboard), and allows a Stacks user to pay a small fee in STX tokens to update that string. The tutorial covers intermediate skills such as error codes, STX token transfer, on-chain data storage, and unit testing using Clarinet.<br></p><p>If you are looking to build off the Billboard tutorial, we challenge you to develop a frontend for the smart contract that could be used in the documentation as an application case study!<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/tutorials/clarity-billboard" target="_blank">Billboard tutorial in the Stacks documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/tree/main/examples/billboard" target="_blank">Full contract code in the Clarinet repository</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h1>🐴 Heystack</h1><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heystack.xyz">Heystack</a> is an example application developed by Hiro’s UserX team in Q2, during their first internal UserX team hackathon. The app is purpose-built as a documentation demo, and gave the team valuable insight into what it’s like to develop on Stacks.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/e-IfT5CI-Gw"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-IfT5CI-Gw"></iframe></div></figure><p>Heystack is a simple messaging application that allows a user to claim fungible tokens and spend them to send messages that are stored on-chain and displayed in a React frontend. The <a href="https://www.github.com/blockstack/heystack" target="_blank">full source of Heystack</a> is available for demonstration purposes, and the documentation contains a case-study and discussion of relevant snippets of the Heystack code.<br></p><p>The Heystack case study is the first example application in the Stacks documentation to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. It serves as a powerful example of the capabilities of Stacks.<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/blockstack/heystack" target="_blank">Heystack repository</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.hiro.so/example-apps/heystack" target="_blank">Case study on Heystack in the Stacks documentation</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h1>🔳 Microblocks</h1><p>Microblocks are the Stacks block streaming model that allow for rapid resolution of transactions between Bitcoin anchor blocks. A major enhancement to the documentation in Q2 focused around educating users on microblocks, and highlighting API and Stacks.js resources for supporting microblocks in your application.<br></p><p>When a block leader is elected, that miner can elect to stream microblocks, and thus earn a portion of the transaction fees generated by transactions that require rapid resolution. This block streaming model solves a common complaint about Bitcoin: average block times between 10 and 15 minutes. With microblocks, transactions on the Stacks blockchain can be settled in seconds, with the full state transition recorded in the subsequent anchor block.<br></p><p>The documentation provides resources on <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/transactions#anchor-mode">how to create microblocks transactions</a>, and a small set of <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/microblocks#best-practices">best-practices on how to include microblocks in your Stacks app</a>.<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/microblocks" target="_blank">Microblocks in the Stacks documentation</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h1>📅 Q3 lookahead</h1><p>Looking ahead to Q3, there are several documentation initiatives in-flight. We’ve been working to improve the visuals on the site, and we’ll be adding additional screenshots and diagrams where appropriate. The first is the completion of an NFT tutorial that was in development for most of Q2. This is another beginner Clarity tutorial that will go over traits and how to use them with Clarinet. We’ll be looking to add at least one more Clarity tutorial during Q3, and a frontend application for that tutorial. I’ll be doing some modifications to the information architecture of the documentation site, and working to prune out outdated and incorrect information from the repo. If you find anything that needs improvement, please file an issue or open a PR.<br></p><p>We are always looking for community contributions to the Stacks documentation. If you want to help but don’t know where to start, check out the issues in the docs repository. Filter by the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first issue</a><strong> </strong>and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+">help wanted</a> tags to see where we’re looking for help.

How does a company like Hiro provide the public tools and services that assist the Stacks blockchain in getting bootstrapped around the globe, and does it differ from running a local node?</p><p>Today, we\'re happy to announce an upcoming series of posts which will cover exactly this and more. In this series we’ll dive deep into how we’ve designed our infrastructure and deployments at Hiro to meet demands, the relevant best practices in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devsecops.org/">DevSecOps</a>, and fluid plans to better support the <a href="https://www.hiro.so/blog/introducing-the-hiro-platform" target="_blank">recently announced Hiro Platform</a> in the future.</p><p>But first, a little background on us — Hiro’s DevOps team wears many hats, and is comprised of Jesse Wiley and myself, Charlie Cantoni.

We\'ll cover the pros and cons of this approach, some alternatives, and show you how we employ blue/green deployments for the Stacks API in the mainnet, testnet, and regtest networks.<br></p><h3>Availability, Resiliency, and Security</h3><p>General best practices and tips for keeping Kubernetes services fast, healthy, and secure. We show you how it ties in to the Stacks node, the Stacks API, Gaia Hub, and other supporting services.<br></p><h3>Monitoring and Logging</h3><p>How can you fix a problem if you\'re not aware of it? And how much logging is <em>too</em> much? One of the most overlooked yet essential key objectives for any infrastructure setup.<br></p><h1>Future Plans</h1><p>Our journey is just beginning; let us show you some improvements we plan to make down the road.<br></p><p>If you’re passionate about DevSecOps and infrastructure engineering like we are, you’ll know it’s an ever-moving, always-improving goalpost as you deepen your understanding and exchange experiences with others. No setup is perfect, and they all have their own drawbacks.

That’s why in June, the UX Team focused most of their efforts on alleviating a lot of this technical debt to set ourselves up for success during the next quarters.<br></p><p>However, it wasn’t a month solely focused on refactoring. We also shipped numerous UX improvements, had our first team hackathon, and planned loads of exciting new features for Q3.</p><h1>🐴 First team hackathon: a demo app for Stack’s documentation</h1><p>One common pitfall teams experience is to become detached from their users and blindly build products based on assumptions and uninformed hypotheses. Even though the UX team makes efforts to work out in the open and close to the Stacks community, we felt that it’s not enough.<br></p><p>Most of the members of the team rarely have time to build applications that interact with the web wallet. That’s why we’ve decided to hold a monthly team hackathon to better understand first-hand what it’s like to build with our product. The goals were to:<br></p><ul><li>Understand our UX and DX better</li><li>Shape the roadmap and keep the team focused on priorities</li><li>Discover bugs before our users report them</li><li>Dogfood our products</li><li>Increase our connection to the ecosystem</li><li>Increase our productivity by having the team engaged and focused on our mission</li><li>Team building, bonding, and fun!</li></ul><h2>Heystack</h2><p>Our first hackathon session was during the first week of June. It resulted in Heystack, a messaging app that demonstrates how to interact with the wallet and smart contracts from a React application.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2976px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2976px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60e708664ac0658f3197fd74_heystack.png" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption>Demo of Heystack</figcaption></figure><p>→ <a href="https://heystack.xyz/" target="_blank">Check out this live Heystack demo application</a><br></p><p>→ <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/examples/heystack" target="_blank">Learn more about Heystack and follow the tutorial</a><br></p><p>→ <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/heystack" target="_blank">Check out the codebase yourself!</a><br></p><h2>What we learned</h2><p>We learned that interacting with Clarity has a relatively steep learning curve, and there wasn’t sufficient documentation for developers to seamlessly grasp its language design and syntax. As a result, a new guide to <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/clarinet">Developing with Clarinet</a> has been written by Hiro’s documentation team.<br></p><p>We also noticed that network selection could be confusing for the user. This motivated us to schedule work to <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-wallet-web/milestone/44" target="_blank">improve the network selection flow</a> for Q3.<br></p><p>Overall, the UX team hackathon was a great experience.

Mostly notably, one abuse vector was found whereby the extension could be embedded into any website. This behavior should be prohibited to prevent sophisticated clickjacking attacks.<br></p><p>The Hiro team swiftly patched this by enabling the frame-ancestors content security policy directive. A new version was published, and the findings were <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.stacks.org/t/upgrade-stacks-wallet-for-web-alpha-now-to-patch-security-vulnerability/11789">disclosed in a forum post</a>, requesting that users upgrade.<br></p><p>As this vulnerability was found during the development of the Stacks Wallet, and the wallet had only been released as a developer preview, we don’t believe it was ever exploited.<br></p><p>Other items from the initial report we’d like to highlight are:</p><h2>Key derivation</h2><p>Our initial implementation used <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> a CPU-bound key derivation function, which is natively available to the browser, as part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#pbkdf2">WebCrypto API spec</a>. <br></p><p>Key derivation is an important mechanism needed to secure encrypted keys against brute force attacks. Rather than using the password directly, it is used to <em>derive</em> an encryption key. This process is, by design, computationally expensive (slow).<br></p><p>While PBKDF2 is <a target="_blank" href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pbkdf2">recommended by OWASP</a>, a newer key derivation library, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.argon2.com/">Argon2</a>, has properties that makes it even more resistant to brute force attacks. We implemented this library in our key derivation logic, resolving suggestion. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2/blob/master/argon2-specs.pdf"><em>Learn more about Argon2 →</em></a></p><h2>Pinning dependencies</h2><p>NPM packages versions by default are described with a caret, such as ^3.11.8. This tells NPM to pull the latest <em>patch</em> version, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://semver.org/">semver</a>, when installing dependencies. It’s possible a bug may be released in one of these versions. For this reason, Least Authority recommended that npm packages be pinned to specific versions, without the caret. This is done by using the --exact flag when installing the packing. To enforce this, a CI task was added to validate the project’s package.json for exact versions. <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-wallet-web/blob/main/.github/actions/check-version-lock/check-version-lock.js" target="_blank"><em>Check out the Github Action →</em></a><br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-wallet-web/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3Aaudit" target="_blank">Here are other issues we’ve solved related to the initial report</a></p><p>‍</p><h1>Final report</h1><p>On April 29th 2021, after addressing the major concerns described in the initial findings, as well as a concluding sign off from the Least Authority team, a final report was delivered. We then felt confident in making the Stacks Wallet live to the public on the Firefox and Chrome stores opening the door for our big release.<br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-wallet-web/blob/main/public/docs/least-authority-security-audit-report.pdf" target="_blank">Download and read the full report here</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:400px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="400px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60df23e918a541daf8620e26_least%20authority.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure>',

        '<p>For part III of the Stacks Crypto Internet Show’s “How to Build on Bitcoin” series, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinfrankiee">Bitcoin Frankie</a>, the founder of Bitcoin Besties, introduced co-hosts <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/PatrickWStanley">Patrick Stanley</a>, founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.joinfreehold.com/">Freehold</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/muneeb?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Muneeb Ali</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stacks.co/">Stacks</a> co-founder and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/">Hiro</a>. The hosting duo talked to featured guests <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/philipdesmedt?lang=it">Philip De Smedt</a>, founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/matthewjablack">Matthew Black</a>, co-founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://atomic.finance/">Atomic Finance</a>, to tackle the topic of “DeFi on the Bitcoin Blockchain.” Listen to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Pakr4iEpI&list=PLXS8JJHIn4nHVwfehAlhqPnZDHef5QY53&index=3">talk</a> in its entirety, or read on for some of the top takeaways.</p><ul><li>DeFi gives us the privacy to communicate with one another using money.</li><li>If you want to build sound infrastructure for sound money, it needs to be built on Bitcoin itself.</li><li>If we have access to the best collateral in the world, why are we sending it to a less secure chain like Ethereum?</li><li>Bitcoin has been stress-tested to last a war time security situation.</li><li>Stacks 2.0 going live opened a world of possibilities. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arkadiko.finance/">Arkadiko</a> started off as an idea from one conversation, but the idea came to life and evolved into an entire DeFi platform. </li></ul><h2><strong>Currency = a Form of Communication</strong></h2><p>Frankie kicked off the conversation about decentralized finance on the Bitcoin blockchain by noting that Bitcoin accounts for roughly half of the crypto space’s trillion-dollar market, and by sharing her thoughts with DeFi on Bitcoin. “Decentralized finance gives us that privacy to communicate with one another using money.” <br></p><p>“But why not Bitcoin, right? The argument that Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions at a time is so outdated,” she continued. “Even according to defiprime.com, they have a total of 220 DeFi projects listed. 205 of those projects are in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, 19 are in the EOS DeFi ecosystem, and 26 are in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. So, it is <strong>happening</strong> y’all.”</p><h2><strong>Building on Bitcoin</strong></h2><p>Muneeb also pushed back on the industry belief that Bitcoin is like a rock, and you can’t build on it. He said he’s taken countless meetings where people are looking to Ethereum or next generation blockchains because they’re under the assumption that you can’t have smart contracts on Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is limited in some other way. &nbsp;“I’m actually very surprised at how much that narrative has taken hold, when the reality is the exact opposite,” he said. <br></p><p>In fact, Atomic Finance began building crosschain on Ethereum and Bitcoin....but then changed tactics. “We were really dismayed at the direction that Ethereum DeFi was going,” said Matt. “So we made the decision last year to go full-in on Bitcoin…if you want to build sound infrastructure for sound money, it needs to be built on Bitcoin itself.”<br></p><p>“We’ve been doing a lot of development specifically with DLCs (Discreet Log Contract), which is a primitive on top of the Bitcoin blockchain itself that allows for the creation of smart contracts and allows for you to create all types of financial contracts, from options to futures. And we’re specifically working on building an easy way for people to make yield on their Bitcoin in a completely transparent and non-custodial manner,” he said.</p><h2><strong>Leveraging Our Collateral</strong></h2><p>Philip made an observation about where we’re storing our assets: “Bitcoin is probably one of the best collateral types in the world. It’s very liquid, the markets never close, it settles in like six blocks, which is an hour approximately. It’s super secure, I can transfer it really quickly,” he said.</p><p>“And so my case for DeFi on Bitcoin is always if we have access to the best collateral in the world, why the hell are we sending it to a less secure chain... Ethereum or whatever? Why do we wrap it? Why do we send it away?” Philip pointed out that one percent of all Bitcoin lives on Ethereum. “Why do we keep doing that? We give up our best assets to — quite frankly — use them on crappier blockchains. I love Ethereum. I love the innovation on it. But we need to stop doing that, I think, as a whole. If we have this great collateral and access to it, why not leverage it?”</p><blockquote>“And so my case for DeFi on Bitcoin is always if we have access to the best collateral in the world, why the hell are we sending it to a less secure chain... Ethereum or whatever? Why do we wrap it? Why do we send it away?” — Philip De Smedt</blockquote><p>People want to use Bitcoin so badly that they’re jumping through hoops to use that within smart contracts. “So, I do think that this model is a little upside down right now, where people are trying to issue Bitcoin on other blockchains, and the more logical thing is to bring smart contracts to where the capital already is, where the security operates,” added Muneeb.</p><blockquote>" I think, as a whole. If we have this great collateral and access to it, why not leverage it?" — Philip De Smedt</blockquote><h2><strong>Wartime Security</strong></h2><p>Ethereum’s developer community is currently the biggest in crypto. And while Muneeb made a point to say that some of those developers are very adept, he argued that Bitcoin has attracted a larger number of extremely sophisticated engineers who give more thought to security, and who understand how to weigh the related trade-offs. <br></p><p>“Because Bitcoin did attract a lot of very sophisticated engineers, you have a very, very solid foundation that is sitting there. Things have been thought through. Imagine if there is an actual wartime scenario where these blockchains are under attack. Which blockchain are you going to feel comfortable storing all of your assets and life savings in?” he posed. “I’ll put that in Bitcoin and I will feel like that’s fine. A lot of these other systems have never actually seen a wartime scenario where someone is actively trying to compromise the integrity of the system, and the kind of problems that can emerge. In Bitcoin, it has been stress-tested. It has that skill set.” </p><h2><strong>The Value of Half-Baked Ideas</strong></h2><p>When discussing a tweak Arkadiko made to its transaction process<strong>*</strong>, Philip gave props to Ali, saying “to be quite honest, Muneeb, you gave us that idea. I never thanked you for that, but it was genius in retrospect.”<br></p><p>To Muneeb, it brought up an interesting point: “That’s awesome to hear. I feel like I need to do more of that. There’s so much potential here, and sometimes the bottleneck is telling people about it,” he said. <br></p><p>“I think on our side, we’re a bunch of computer scientists, and our first reaction is to not release something until we have fixed all the holes. We don’t feel very uncomfortable — me included — to publicly release something that we don’t think we’ve done a thorough enough job at. And in some ways, the opposite is the way to go in crypto,” Muneeb argued. <br></p><p>“The idea you’re talking about was a half-baked type of an idea. But we put it out there, and before you know it, Arkadiko is working on it. We need to do more of that. We need to focus. The thing I’m taking a lot more seriously now, especially with Stacks 2.0 live, is that instead of going heads-down more on the technology, we need to be more vocal and say ‘here are the different things that are possible.’ Maybe some of the ideas are half-baked, but that’s fine. There’s so many smart people in the Bitcoin ecosystem who can take that and run with it, and maybe improve it.”</p><p><strong><em>* </em></strong><em>The Arkadiko smart contract would temporarily hold the stablecoin until the bitcoin is paid back (or in case of non-payment, the stablecoin is sent to the lender). This is one of the first trustless non-custodian bitcoin lending/borrowing applications that is possible without bitcoin leaving the bitcoin blockchain, thanks to the ability for Clarity smart contracts to read bitcoin state.</em></p><h4><em>Listen to the Defi on Bitcoin conversation in its entirety: </em></h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://youtu.be/w9Pakr4iEpI"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9Pakr4iEpI"></iframe></div></figure><h4><em>To listen to more of the series, visit the </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3J2iHnyt2JtOvtGVf_jpHQ" target="_blank"><em>Stacks YouTube</em></a><em> page.</em><br></h4>',

        "The Stacks blockchain settles blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain, which averages one block every ten minutes. In order to provide users and applications with more timely feedback on the status and results of transactions, the blockchain supports microblocks. This post will talk about how microblocks are supported in the blockchain, how they impact the confirmation of transactions, and previews support for microblocks in explorers, wallets, and applications.",
      "post-body":
        '<p>Microblocks in the Stacks blockchain will soon be supported in the Stacks Blockchain API and tooling for faster transaction processing. Stacks blocks will always settle on the Bitcoin blockchain as the ultimate source of truth, but microblocks introduce a new lower-latency global view of the Stacks blockchain transaction state. Microblocks are designed to improve the experience for users and developers and are a step further in scaling bitcoin.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Microblocks and Stacks Transactions</h2><p>The Stacks blockchain takes a batching approach to transactions, which allows for thousands of transactions to be settled in a single Bitcoin transaction. Microblocks enable an even speedier approach. The Bitcoin blockchain runs on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time">~10 min block times</a>, but developers and end users would benefit from faster transaction times. Microblocks will vastly decrease latency for interacting with the Stacks blockchain when it comes to processing transactions, such as STX token transfers, web wallet interactions in apps, and transaction signing among others, conveying transaction status in a matter of seconds as compared to minutes. </p><p>Microblocks are a concept borrowed from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-eyal.pdf">Bitcoin-NG</a>, a research paper published at USENIX ATC 2016. Microblocks introduce a new option for the current Stacks miner to stream transactions into microblocks from the mempool with microblock-specific mining rewards. Developers gain more flexibility in how they submit transactions to miners as well. &nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h2>Implementation and Status </h2><p>Microblocks at the protocol layer were part of the Stacks 2.0 launch, and miners have been able to produce them since January. Full end-to-end support for microblocks in user-facing tools, like the explorer and wallet, are in the implementation and testing phases. The Hiro team is working on the remaining client support for sending transactions in microblocks, as well as designs to convey a transaction’s status in a microblock stream to end users via the Stacks Web Wallet and Explorer. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2338px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2338px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60d0ca8552004e6312f9f874_Group%205052.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>A sneak peak of designs by Hiro\'s UserX team</figcaption></figure><p>Microblocks are a design choice that both offers the end-user the benefit of lower-latency transactions, and embodies the decentralization and open access to mining and transacting on the Stacks blockchain. Microblocks can offer better user experiences to applications that need lower-latency confirmations than what are traditionally offered by blockchains.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Microblocks will be a major improvement in UX for those building on and accessing apps, smart contracts, DeFi and other projects on the Stacks blockchain, and one of many improvements we expect to see in the Stacks approach bringing apps and smart contracts to Bitcoin. &nbsp;</p><p>We will be sharing technical proposals and design guidelines for microblocks usage inside of apps in the coming weeks, but those interested in diving further into the details should review the Stacks Blockchain SIP-001 available on GitHub (link: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-001/sip-001-burn-election.md">https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-001/sip-001-burn-election.md</a>), follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-api/pull/612">Microblocks API PR on GitHub</a>, and we just published <a href="https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/microblocks" target="_blank">additional documentation</a> including best practices. </p><p>‍</p><h4><strong><em>Additional Info: Mining Microblocks</em></strong></h4><p>Stacks miners are incentivized to mine microblocks on an ongoing basis, but are not required to do so. Microblock transaction fees are split 40/60 between the producer of the microblock and the subsequent miner that builds a Stacks block that confirms it. The 40% fee for the miner that produces the microblock is what encourages the miner to actively mine microblocks, instead of ignoring subsequent transactions. The 60% fee for the miner that confirms the microblock is what encourages it to download and confirm them, instead of dropping them. Aside from earning a portion of microblock transaction fees, rewards miners might choose to mine microblocks to benefit the Stacks blockchain and ecosystem as well. <br></p><p>Because a Stacks miner can choose which (if any) microblocks it confirms, a transaction’s confirmation status transitions through increasing degrees of “confirmation certainty.” &nbsp;These can be thought of as intermediate confirmation states between zero and one confirmations in traditional blockchains. It is uncertain if an unconfirmed transaction in the mempool will be mined. But, once the transaction gets included in a microblock, it is more certain that it will be mined, because there is now a financial incentive for the next Stacks miner to confirm it. A transaction’s confirmation certainty increases further as more and more Stacks miners send block-commit transactions to Bitcoin’s mempool that correspond to Stacks blocks that would confirm the microblock if selected by the next sortition. Once the microblock stream is confirmed by a subsequent Stacks block, it receives the same degree of confirmation certainty as the Stacks block that confirmed it (i.e. one confirmation).<br></p><p>Users have the option to choose whether or not their transaction <em>must</em> be included in a microblock, <em>must</em> be included in a Stacks block, or<em> may</em> be included in either. If on the one hand the user is willing to trade confirmation certainty for lower latency, then the user would require that the transaction be mined only in a microblock stream, and not a Stacks block. If on the other hand the user is more concerned about confirmation certainty, and less concerned about latency, the user would require that the transaction be mined in a Stacks block. If the user does not care strongly either way, then the user would permit the miner to choose how the transaction is mined.</p><p>‍</p>',

        '<p>Our guest this week is Pavitthra Pandurangan, a Distributed Systems Engineer here at Hiro. As this is our first session we’d like to keep this pretty casual and there wont be a lot of structure, rhyme or reason to this interview so let’s hop right in!</p><p>‍</p><h4><strong><em>— Thanks for volunteering to be our first guest. Could you quickly introduce yourself to our readers? What is it you’d say you do here at Hiro?</em></strong></h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:320px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatleft" data-rt-max-width="320px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60c9cef5b89ece193d0e95f0_Pavi.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>I’m a Distributed systems engineer, level 2. I work on a wide variety of things that the blockchain team needs. I’m still at the point where I’m gaining a lot of context so I don’t say no to a lot of tasks. My work ranges from working on the Clarity language to working on meta stuff for the Clarity language like static analysis, to mempool logic, things like metrics logging for Prometheus, to even just adding API endpoints. I’ve been able to work on the full spectrum of tasks and yet there’s more to try.</p><h4><strong><em>— How long have you been in this role?</em></strong></h4><p>I just joined on February 1st, so I’m getting to three and a half months now. </p><h4><strong><em>— Sounds like a lots been happening this year. I also heard you just came back from surfing in California. Was it hard to come back to the northeast?</em></strong></h4><p>It was hard! I went to California for five weeks, and then I went to Colorado for a few weeks. I’ve realized my people are West Coast people. I never knew that before, but I loved the culture and the fact that everyone does every kind of sport there. Now that I’m back in the city, I’m trying to find even a patch of grass, versus before I had mountains outside my window.</p><h4><strong><em>— Were you working remotely or did you take time off?</em></strong></h4><p>I was working remotely the entire time and had taken just two days off. I worked during the day and at night would go on the trail or on weekends would do fun full day stuff.</p><h4><strong><em>— So taking a new job is always a bit of a leap of faith and I know when you joined you had other opportunities you were considering. What was it about Hiro that made you decide that this was the right leap to take?</em></strong></h4><p>Well it definitely hit all my check boxes; small company, highly technical role, distributed systems. I think what made it special and pushed it over the edge was the energy of the people here. Everyone was very welcoming and it was generally clear that people genuinely liked working here and that’s not easy to fake. As an example, one of my interviewers who is now my onboarding buddy, was on vacation when I got my offer. He emailed me after I received my offer and said he’d love to talk to me if I had any questions - even though he was out of office! The fact that a team member was willing to reach out to me on vacation showed their enthusiasm.</p><h4><strong><em>— What are some of your favorite things about the team/culture?</em></strong></h4><p>I’ve noticed people really want to take initiative even outside their role or domain. People are also very grateful for the work others do. We have a general culture of recognition, an example of which is our kudos during our weekly all hands meeting.</p><h4><strong><em>— What has been the biggest surprise since you joined?</em></strong></h4><p>I think the biggest surprise was the time I had for onboarding. I had a whole month to just read and learn and absorb knowledge about crypto in general and how we do things. I took the latter two weeks to learn Rust and read half of a textbook on the language - all before starting to work on any tasks. That was very valuable and not every workplace does that. Allotting that much time for onboarding takes a type of long term thinking that not every place has.</p><h4><strong><em>— Moving into Crypto, what advice would you want to share for others contemplating making the move?</em></strong></h4><p>Do it! But no really, I think what my general advice would be is to vet the company the way you’d vet investing in a cryptocurrency because you’re investing in it even more, since you’re investing your time. Is the project going anywhere? Do they have a vision that’s actually long term as opposed to just trying to make bank on their ICO? Finding a team thats genuinely interested in something higher than just the price of a token is a good indicator that it’s something that will last for awhile.</p><h4><strong><em>— For engineers, specifically trying to decide if Crypto is the right thing for them what advise would you tell them to consider?</em></strong></h4><p>I think something that would be true across the board regardless of what crypto project they’re working on, is that it’s going to be cutting edge. If you’re the type of engineer that is looking for that type of challenge and wants to discuss things that are unprecedented where you can’t really just google the solution then this is probably the right fit for you. You can’t get as much of that anywhere else you look. I feel like crypto is the best matchup of theory and practical engineering that you can find, in my opinion.</p><h4><strong><em>— What is the most exciting thing you’ve been involved with in your time at Hiro?</em></strong></h4><p>I feel like I’m literally learning new things every week but I think I would choose the static analysis project. The static analysis project is about determining the cost of a transaction (without actually executing the transaction). The only reason that’s possible is because Clarity is not a Turing complete language - normally this would be an impossible problem to solve. In preparation for this task, Reed &amp; I read three papers on programming language theory that were dense and technical. Trying to extrapolate the useful parts of that for what we needed to do was… quite interesting.</p><p>The other fun part of working here is learning about the general design and architecture of the blockchain, and getting to ask questions to the people who built it. That was just so cool. As part of my onboarding, I read the SIPs. For anything I didn’t understand, I would be able to go to Aaron or Jude for an in-depth explanation.</p><h4><strong><em>— Any advice for new engineers looking at SIPs on how to approach them?</em></strong></h4><p>I think I’d suggest approaching it like a research paper, I generally take notes and pretty much underline what confuses me. Mostly its just a straight forward component of the blockchain so you can easily just read it and tackle it. I was recommended a reading order when I joined, and maybe that ordering is something we could make public.</p><h4><strong><em>— What is something unique about the way we do things here at Hiro, that you wish other companies would do?</em></strong></h4><p>It often feels like we’re trying to do the right thing, not necessarily the fastest thing. For example, the design of Clarity took years to think about and develop but it was the best path. We wanted to give people something that was better and more secure that would last a long time.</p><h4><strong><em>— Well that was all terrific! Thanks! Any parting thoughts?</em></strong></h4><p>I’m not sure I said this but everyone is super nice! Working with nice, low ego people leads to having a great working environment.</p><p>‍</p>',

        '<p>Decentralized technology has opened a world of opportunities, business models, and community involvement. Bitcoin is an effective store of value because it takes a limited functionality approach, but Bitcoin capital can be better deployed to take advantage of the innovation we’re seeing in DeFi products, apps, scaling innovations and more that are all accessible in the Ethereum ecosystem today. </p><p>A number of projects have made headway on different approaches on the space and there are some early traction points to explore. This is a snapshot of some of the commonly referred to projects building on Bitcoin, all collectively adding to discourse that Bitcoin unlocks more opportunity for entrepreneurs to serve untapped Bitcoin capital. <em>Disclaimer: I am employed by an entity that builds in the Stacks ecosystem. DYOR!</em></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:75%" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="75%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60c34b8a3871a4454dccc3be_table.png" loading="lazy" alt="Comparison table" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Comparison table for projects building on Bitcoin</figcaption></figure><h2>Layered Approaches, Side Chains, and Stacks </h2><p>A typical first question when approaching Stacks and other Bitcoin based projects is to try to identify what layer they are. Sidechains and Layer 2s are well known approaches within the crypto ecosystem, but there are additional models to explore when it comes to expanding functionality of Bitcoin as a base cryptocurrency. <br></p><p>Sidechains typically port a direct 1-1 relationship value from a token to a new blockchain. In the case of RSK and Liquid, there is no new token introduced, rather a tokenized version of bitcoin to be used on a different network, usable in ways that it can’t be on the Bitcoin blockchain natively today. <br></p><p>Layer 2s like Lightning introduce scalability through protocol developments on top of a base blockchain, in this instance Bitcoin. Note: there are a ton of exciting developments in the Bitcoin dev ecosystem like Taproot and Sapio that are improving upon the Bitcoin network directly, but are not focused on in this article.<br></p><p>Stacks is an independent chain — with a native token to incentivize Stacks miners — that’s anchored to Bitcoin via the PoX consensus. The Stacks network introduces a token for transacting on the network, as is the case with almost every smart contract platform to prevent spam and ensure efficient network and compute resourcing. It doesn’t port bitcoin value 1-1 as a side chain, and is a fully separate blockchain — so not quite a layer 2 blockchain, either. <br></p><p>Stacks introduced the first consensus model between two blockchains and builds on Bitcoin as a secure and decentralized store of value protocol. Stacks adds scalability and smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem, allowing for business models that have flourished on smart contract platforms such as Ethereum to be built on the Bitcoin standard. Stacks builds upon the strengths of the Bitcoin network’s security, open access, and decentralization and expands the Bitcoin ecosystem and value proposition. Stacks is not a store of value; it is used for transaction fees and running smart contracts that are anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain, and by holding STX end users can participate in Stacks consensus and earn Bitcoin rewards in the process. &nbsp; </p><p>‍</p><h2>Capital and Traction </h2><p>Another question is about opportunity space and access to capital. Liquid, RSK and Lightning require locking or provisioning BTC capital to access benefits of the network. Stacks runs adjacently to the Bitcoin blockchain, so users don’t have to make a decision to move their BTC elsewhere to participate — they can do so fully through the native Stacks token. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:60%" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="60%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/60c3437cbc9cb29da3636640_YKg_6V7I.png" loading="lazy" alt="TVL Across Bitcoin Projects Graph" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Bitcoin projects vying for capital. The Stacks category reflects value locked in STX tokens paying Bitcoin rewards.</figcaption></figure><p>Many projects are creating bridges between ecosystems and have found some traction porting BTC liquidity to Ethereum (wBTC, REN, RSK). These projects allow BTC holders to cross ecosystems and take advantage of DeFi primitives in the Ethereum ecosystem. While these efforts are a step forward in putting Bitcoin capital to work, Stacks doubles down on this value add by allowing for tokenized bitcoin on Stacks or xBTC more natively in the Bitcoin ecosystem. </p><p>‍</p><h2>Building in Harmony with Bitcoin</h2><p>Instead of having to exit the BTC ecosystem in some way, Stacks provides a native connection to Bitcoin chain state allowing for smart contract functionality for Bitcoin. The two layer-one blockchains act in tandem — Stacks blocks settle on the Bitcoin blockchain and smart contracts on Stacks have direct visibility into the Bitcoin chain state. <br></p><p>Transactions on the Stacks blockchain are settled on Bitcoin. All fork histories of Stacks are secured by Bitcoin and to alter them an attacker would have to reorg Bitcoin. This is done without Bitcoin miners having to be aware of Stacks’ existence or taking part in validating Stacks transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin grows stronger with each project taking a unique approach to growing the Bitcoin based GDP. Developer adoption is still incredibly early, but Bitcoin as the largest and strongest cryptocurrency remains an untapped resource for builders. Stacks is taking a unique approach to adding functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain without changing Bitcoin. The design decisions of having a token asset for smart contract deployment and allowing an open mining system allow a fully decentralized approach.<br></p><p>It’s still early days, but gradually I expect to see a shift in narrative. <em>Building</em> and <em>Bitcoin</em> don’t need to be either or. We have yet to see what can be built on Bitcoin, but with additional use cases the bull case for Bitcoin grows. </p>',

      name: "There's Nowhere To Hide With Clarity",
      "post-body":
        '<p>I joined Hiro in early 2020 as the Product Lead for Developer Experiences. During my first few weeks, I began researching and learning everything I could about the new Stacks 2.0 blockchain. Initially I was thrown off, but also intrigued, by some very particular engineering design decisions. Stacks was investigating novel and nuanced implementations of blockchain tech, and always had an inclination to zig when others zag. In addition, Stacks had the advantage of being a fast learner in the smart contract space when the new Stacks blockchain was designed. It was possible to absorb the learnings that unfolded in the Ethereum space during and after the ICO craze. And - there were plenty!</p><p>This post aims to highlight two seemingly little design decisions of the Stacks blockchain that have a big potential: Truly verifiable and usable smart contract sources. Let me explain…</p><h4><br>The Passing of the Baton</h4><p>With the rise of smart contracts, individuals no longer have to trust each other that a contractual obligation will be met. While that may be true, the trust has now shifted onto the developer of a smart contract. One could argue that passing the baton to an unfamiliar developer makes it even more difficult to ensure accountability. How many of us know and trust a developer of a smart contract we might want to interact with?</p><p>This challenge is nowadays mostly tackled in a few ways: </p><p>• Developers are open-sourcing the uncompiled sources of contracts. This is a great idea, but doesn’t guarantee that the contract being signed is based off this source version.<br>• Companies are auditing smart contracts and developers release the reports. This is a very valuable solution, but in similar ways passes the baton to another entity that we have to trust.<br>• Blockchain explorers enable developers to upload the sources for deployed contract manually. The explorer would collect some information and verify it against the byte-code of a contract on the network. This is a great solution, but relies on manual work and explorer support.</p><p>To alleviate some of these transparency pain points, Stacks did two things differently: First, it decided to use a non-compiled smart contracting language, <a href="https://clarity-lang.org/" target="_blank">Clarity</a>. Second, it made it mandatory to publicize the source of each contract. As a result, every smart contract deployed on the Stacks network includes the executable, uncompiled, and human-readable source.</p><p><strong>This is a very important outcome: Individuals do not have to trust other entities! They can verify and trust the deployed contract itself.</strong></p><p>Now, how do these design decisions affects developers? In short, it enables the “GitHub of smart contracts”.</p><h4><br>A Smart Contract Flywheel </h4><p>In the current stage of the blockchain space, smart contract developers have a particularly difficult task. Oftentimes, they have to learn new languages (or flavors thereof), working sample code is hard to locate, and there’s frequently a new way of doing things or best practices being standardized.</p><p>The most successful smart contracting platforms do their best to collect great sample projects, annotate and comment code pieces, and make them more discoverable. <a href="https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts" target="_blank">OpenZepplin Contracts</a> is a fantastic example of such a collection. The difficulties with solutions like this are pretty well-understood: They either have to be maintained constantly or will start to create negative effects (outdated sample code is frustrating).</p><p>Thanks to the aforementioned design decisions, the Stacks network excels in this area. Thanks to the of the availability of executable, uncompiled, human-readable sources for any smart contract deployed on the Stacks blockchain, developers get access to always up-to-date, functional smart contracts. Websites such as GitHub can make it easy for developers to discover relevant code samples, learn from other developers’ code, and kickstart their own projects.</p><p>I think over the course of the next years we will see the Stacks smart contract flywheel taking off: </p><p><strong>Availability of working contracts will attract developers. Developers will be able to build off of existing smart contracts, making even more contracts available for even more developers.</strong></p><p>The best part of all of this: It is not a vision for the future! We don’t have to wait much longer, and the discoverability of Clarity contracts is already being utilized. Head over to the tool, <a href="https://search-clarity.dev/" target="_blank">Clarity Search</a>, to find over 70+ working smart contracts deployed to the Stacks mainnet and start building your own smart contract on Bitcoin! This new smart contract archive pulls data directly from the blockchain, and displays an organized list sorted by recently deployed. No longer will you have to comb through the Explorer to locate a particular contract. Clarity Search is a powerful search engine that lets you select certain parameters and and filters. It also displays interesting metrics like the number of contract calls a file performs, or the overall complexity of the code. This will be absolutely integral for quickly browsing the network for functional smart contracts already in production. </p><p>Good luck on your smart contract safari, developers! </p>',

        '<p>One of the best ways to inspire developers has always been hackathons. Hackers get a full cup of coffee and prepare themselves for a coding marathon. We have run countless public hackathons, and every time the builders in the community surprise us with their out-of-the-box problem solving and innovative use of Stacks. However, we thought an internal hackathon would be a perfect way to leverage the brainpower of all the employees at Hiro while also having some fun!<br></p><p>In an unprecedented move at Hiro, we halted normal day-to-day work to give the hackathon three whole days of undivided attention. We truly wanted to give everyone the free time and flexibility to dream up the coolest possible ideas they could.<br></p><p>We broke down the rationale for an internal hackathon and set explicit goals. First and foremost, in the words of Spongebob Squarepants: <strong>F-U-N!</strong> 2021 has been heads-down for everyone at Hiro, so we wanted an opportunity for people to put normal work on the backburner for a bit and spend some time hacking on ideas they found exciting and enjoyable. Second, we wanted to try giving engineers unstructured time to explore passion projects and channel creative energy. Third, with a couple of new Hiros on the team and our operations still being remote-first, we thought it was important to catalyze some team bonding! Last but not least, we wanted to see what would happen when our engineers sink their teeth into our own products. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30784/dogfooding#:~:text=Techopedia%20Explains%20Dogfooding-,What%20Does%20Dogfooding%20Mean%3F,bugs%2C%20as%20in%20beta%20testing.">Dogfooding</a> is a fantastic way to learn more about the technology that is being developed, and the hackathon projects really took advantage of all the components Stacks offers. <br></p><p>What resulted was magical: Three whole days of uninhibited hacking with each and every Hiro collaborating to create immensely valuable projects. Github repositories lit up with activity, memes became the standard form of communication in the Discord, and all the teams buckled-down for a shot at the hackathon podium. Nobody was messing around with top-shelf prizes up for grabs like custom Stacks Crocs, personalized Nike shoes, or the grand prize of a choice between a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whoop.com/">WHOOP</a> membership or <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/" target="_blank">Oculus Quest 2</a>.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright" style="max-width:200px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatright" data-rt-max-width="200px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828a88a3e42f4f776a7f_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620660960483_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-10%2Bat%2B11.34.01%2BAM.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Hiro\'s Internal Hackathon NFT</figcaption></figure><p>New toys are cool and all, but the real grand prize was a totally new, custom NFT created by Hiro Designer Eugenia Digon. This one-of-a-kind digital artwork represents all the hard work that went into the hackathon, and will live on the Stacks blockchain forever! It embodies the Hiro value that the theme of the entire hackathon: We Engineer Moonshots. Hiro has always thought far into the future, and has engineered technology to usher in the next era of the internet and digital interactions. This NFT signifies the radical thinking and futurist mindset personified by each and every Hiro. </p><p>When the dust settled, the entire Hiro team came together on Friday for a Demo Day celebration that left jaws on the floor. Each group of hackers had the chance to give a short presentation on their experience building their project, and some were even brave enough to show off live demos! Eventually, the cream of the crop rose to the top: A protocol to exchange BTC with any fungible or non-fungible token defined in Clarity. A memecoin implementing a new proof-of-meme protocol based on everyone’s favorite Hiro pet. Totally revamped deployment workflow and documentation for Gaia storage hubs. In just three days, Hiro made blockchain magic happen and cranked out some crazy crypto creations. <br></p><h1>First Place: ???</h1><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1700px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1700px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828988a3e495aa776a7d_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620842284706_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-12%2Bat%2B1.49.45%2BPM.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Stay Tuned...</figcaption></figure><p>As much as we would love to share with you details of the hackathon project that took the top spot in the internal hackathon, we’ll have to keep you on the edge of your seat a bit longer. This hackathon team came up with such a rockstar idea, that they want to continue to develop the platform and bring it to production! It’s an absolutely out-of-the-box idea, that lives at the intersection of NFTs, token economics, and fashion. The team is so excited to unveil their project to the community soon, and recommends you start to clear out some space in your wardrobe…</p><h1>WhaleStreet</h1><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:800px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="800px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828a4f37d51efaedc331_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620662998768_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-10%2Bat%2B12.09.51%2BPM.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>WhaleStreet</figcaption></figure><p>Decentralized token exchanges have exploded in popularity as trusted alternatives to centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Gemini, or Binance. Being able to swap tokens or provide liquidity in a trustless, decentralized manner is a huge benefit blockchain offers. In the Stacks ecosystem, we take immense pride in our connection to Bitcoin and the way the Proof-of-Transfer consensus mechanism leverages BTC’s security. However, we want even more ways for Bitcoin and Stacks to interact, and incentivize BTC holders to experiment with other protocols. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright" style="max-width:200px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatright" data-rt-max-width="200px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e8d39426da8a63322cb03_Screen%20Shot%202021-05-12%20at%2012.12.58%20PM.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>WhaleStreet is hot on the scene, ready to pave Main Street in the Stacks (de)financial district. This team created an entire protocol to exchange BTC with any fungible or non-fungible token defined in Clarity. </p><p>Hiro Engineers Ludo Galabru and Pavitthra Pandurangan set out with two distinct design goals. First, they wanted WhaleStreet to be able to perform the token swaps with a <strong>single transaction</strong>, no daisy-chaining, wrapping, unwrapping, or conversion required. Second, they wanted to allow a BTC holder to perform a token swap <strong>without holding any native STX</strong> tokens in their wallet. Overcoming these two constraints would drastically reduce the barrier of entry for newcomers, and open up the Stacks ecosystem to even more Bitcoiners.</p><p>They started by implementing a direct, P2P orderbook. However, it could be difficult sometimes to find the exact, desired trade a user was looking to execute. The team decided to upgrade their design mid-hackathon based on learnings, which is what good development is all about! Their final, improved design evolved the P2P orderbook into a fully-fledged liquidity pool. This liquidity pool is managed by the WhaleStreet protocol, and allows for much quicker, specialized trades. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2026px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2026px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e8d7aefd9c40f39bfc31b_Screen%20Shot%202021-05-12%20at%2012.13.22%20PM.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>WhaleStreet Protocol Visualization</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s say Alice wants to trade her BTC for some of Bob’s Clarity tokens that he already added to the liquidity pool. Alice simply pings the Whalestreet node and receives template for structuring her swapping transaction. She then submits her transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. The WhaleStreet node then automatically monitors the Bitcoin blockchain for when Alice’s transaction is confirmed. Once Alice’s BTC transaction is verified, the Clarity tokens she wanted are transferred to a new STX wallet that she controls. Finally, after all is said and done, the WhaleStreet protocol rebalances the liquidity pool, and will even halt transactions if there isn’t enough liquidity. </p><p>Stacks has always championed its unique connection with Bitcoin, and now we are truly seeing that potential be fully investigated by powerful applications such as WhaleStreet. Bitcoiners want to experiment with DeFi, token swaps, and other recent blockchain innovations. Enabling them to obtain Clarity tokens with a single transaction and no STX balance is efficient and accessible. <br></p><h1>$BIMBA Coin</h1><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2350px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2350px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828a6b2c757c968e4277_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620662900582_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-10%2Bat%2B12.08.09%2BPM.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright" style="max-width:200px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatright" data-rt-max-width="200px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828bd5917c560977cd5d_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620753150029_WhatsApp%2BImage%2B2021-05-05%2Bat%2B11.03.14%2BAM%2B1.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Say Hello to Bimba</figcaption></figure><p>Once in a generation, humanity is gripped by a cultural movement so visceral, so captivating, that there is no stopping its upward potential.

Move over Shiba Inu, ‘cause this powerful Pomeranian is on the launchpad ready for takeoff. <br></p><p>Say hello to Bimba, the unofficial animal mascot of Hiro Systems PBC. Bimba is the trusted companion of Mark Hendrickson, Product Lead on Hiro’s UserX team, and is constantly making appearances in the background of Zoom calls. Bimba is such a positive, iconic force in the blockchain industry, that it just made sense to leverage her awesome cuteness as the foundation for the world’s next big cryptocurrency. <br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright" style="max-width:200px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatright" data-rt-max-width="200px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828add9cfb7a49823781_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620836183329_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-12%2Bat%2B11.58.21%2BAM.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>The Circle of Bimba</figcaption></figure><p>Enter $BIMBA coin, a prototype Clarity token on the Stacks blockchain. If implemented, $BIMBA would be a fungible token that uses a totally novel Proof-of-Meme (PoM) protocol, and incentivizes content creation. Conceptually, users would be rewarded with $BIMBA by spreading the message on social media with memes and tweets. Bimba not only embraces the power of memes, but leverages it to catalyze participation.<br></p><p>BIMBA is only as strong as its community, and the spirit of BIMBA should be alive within each and every crypto enthusiast. As outrageous as the proof-of-meme protocol appears, it is actually a genius way to bootstrap a community and incentivize involvement. People already spent hours on the internet creating memes, it is only fair they should be compensated for their content generation. The project also exemplified how easy it can be to spin up a token in Clarity on Stacks. In just three days, Team BIMBA took a funny idea and turned it into a polished product. </p><h1>G^3: Great Gaia Guidance</h1><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828b00a49f62680e3169_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620838135300_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-12%2Bat%2B12.48.46%2BPM.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Gaia has always been a powerful tool in the toolbox of Stacks developers. Having a dedicated location to quickly store and retrieve data is absolutely critical when building smart contracts or decentralized applications. The Gaia storage system allows you to store private application data efficiently off-chain, but still access it securely with Stacks applications. <br></p><p>One hackathon team, made up of infrastructure wizzes Charlie Cantoni and Jesse Wiley, took it upon themselves to give Gaia the makeover it truly deserved. Not only did they completely reconfigure the deployment workflow, but they also overhauled the documentation to assist developers every step of the way. <br></p><p>The entire Gaia workflow has been overhauled. The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) was update to be Debian-based, which is much easier to work with and presents drastically less constraints. Cross-cloud interoperability is also now possible if you wanted to use a different cloud provider like Azure. Last but not least, both EC2 and S3 storage support is baked directly into the template. <br></p><p>Deploying a new Gaia instance is as easy as ever. A new tutorial has been authored that provides guidance every step of the way. There is now a button directly in the docs that will take you to the new AWS Cloudformation template. Additionally, a docker-compose option has been added that will drastically simplifies the deployment that happens on the virtual machine. From the template, you simply enter various configuration details for the hub (such as instance type) and it’s deployed in a couple clicks. Now you’re all ready to upload or read data straight from the deployed Gaia storage hub! <br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright" style="max-width:100px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatright" data-rt-max-width="100px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ff21113877dd79ed7913b57/609e828bf0ba5b4e6508c551_s_652FC83DB4FAA8C7E36F3B83185C1582F295DE825A9C34BA558706E46205A97F_1620838178691_Screen%2BShot%2B2021-05-12%2Bat%2B12.48.27%2BPM.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>A huge shoutout to Documentation Engineer Patrick Grey, one of Hiro’s newest additions, on his contributions to the Gaia revamp.

The best example is the lifecycle of a transaction. Consider all the states when you send some STX or make a contract call: pending broadcast request, broadcast success (or fail), transaction added to the mempool, and finally the transaction is mined and included in a block.</p><p>For example, let’s say a Stacks developer is building an app that has a user interface updating users as their transactions progress. This requires a handful of different components: HTTP polling requests, and a soup of logic to manage it. These can be cumbersome and not very fun to wrangle. Yet, to provide a compelling user experience, apps must give feedback of these actions.</p><p>RxStacks asks “how this can be easier?”.

      "post-body":
        '<p>Earlier, in January of this year, Hiro <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.blockstack.org/stacks-cryptocurrency-securities-filing/">announced</a> that it would no longer treat Stacks tokens as securities under U.S. federal securities laws following the successful launch of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. Out of an abundance of caution, Hiro had previously treated the cryptocurrency as a security in the U.S., leading to its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-clears-blockstack-to-hold-first-regulated-token-offering-11562794848">2019 token offering</a> under Regulation A and subjecting itself to the same periodic information disclosures required of more-traditional securities offerings. At the time, however, Hiro also laid out its long-term plan to decentralize the Stacks ecosystem so that neither Hiro nor anyone else would play an essential managerial role that could reasonably be expected to be the driver of potential returns for Stacks holders. Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s <em>Howey</em> test, this lack of an essential managerial role would mean the Stacks tokens no longer qualify as securities.<br></p><p>Two years later, this plan has led to what we expect to be our last annual report (Form 1-K) <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1693656/000119312521134674/d41884dpartii.htm">filed with the SEC today</a> and is anticipated to culminate in the upcoming filing of an exit report (Form 1-Z), signifying the formal end of Hiro’s reporting obligations under Regulation A. <br></p><p>We’re proud of our regulatory path and hope that it can serve as a model for others seeking to innovate in the crypto industry.<br></p><p><strong>Forward-looking statements</strong></p><p><em>This communication contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us.

      name: "Introducing the Hiro Platform ",
      "post-body":
        '<p>After the launch of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain in January, we’ve seen tremendous interest from developers in building smart contracts for Bitcoin. Hiro is now more narrowly focused on developers. Anyone can use the open-source Stacks software to use and develop smart contracts. With the hosted Hiro Platform we want to make it easier for startups and enterprises to build on the Stacks and Bitcoin blockchains. Hiro has always been an open-source company and we will continue our commitment to open source.<br></p><p>Earlier, at Hiro PBC (formerly known as Blockstack PBC), our focus was on building the public infrastructure for decentralized apps and smart contracts, specifically around Bitcoin. During this phase, we did the early research and development of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. With the launch of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain by independent miners, Hiro PBC no longer plays an essential managerial role for the Stacks blockchain. We’re excited to have a narrowed focus on developer tools. Stacks 2.0 went live in January 2021 and after 2 months there is <a target="_blank" href="https://stacking.club/">$800M+ total value locked</a> in the PoX smart contract, with <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.stacks.org/t/advanced-clarity-smart-contract-examples/11655">several other smart contracts</a> being developed in the ecosystem.<br></p><p>Blockchains enable new types of computer programs: (a) smart contracts that can be published on a blockchain to execute in a trustless manner, and (b) decentralized apps that are user-owned and avoid centralized servers. Ethereum demonstrated the power of decentralized apps and smart contracts, and Stacks brings these capabilities to Bitcoin. At Hiro, our thesis is that in the long term, the broader Bitcoin ecosystem can emerge as the center of gravity for crypto. Enabling apps and smart contracts directly on top of Bitcoin can unlock this potential.<br></p><p>Hiro Platform is planned to be a hosted service that will make it easy for developers to build on the Stacks blockchain. Areas of focus include testing and deploying smart contracts, spinning up nodes and other server-side resources for scaling, and monitoring and analytics. Hiro Platform will provide the convenience and reliability that developers have come to expect from cloud-hosted platforms and APIs like Stripe for payments and Twilio for telecommunication infrastructure, while the underlying network remains decentralized and open.<br></p><p>Hiro Platform is planned to be a hosted service on top of decentralized blockchains. The Hiro Platform can only exist on top of public blockchains like Bitcoin and Stacks that provide the core consensus and decentralized smart contracts functionality; it couldn’t exist until the successful launch of Stacks 2.0. Our work on developer tools and hosted services for Stacks helps move the industry in the direction of a user-owned internet built on Bitcoin.<br></p><p>The Hiro team has been engaging with developers and identifying areas for improvement. We’re gathering insights from app and smart contract creators, our internal development team, and integration partners. We plan to share more details on upcoming focus areas, but in the near term we are working on improvements to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js">Stacks.js</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-api/issues/355">Microblocks</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://clarity-lang.org/">Clarity lang</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiro.so/wallet/install-web">Stacks Wallet for Web</a>, and improving developer documentation and the developer onboarding experience.<br></p><p>Hiro remains a public-benefit corporation building open-source software. We have strides to make in improving the Stacks developer experience, and are thrilled to work on the Hiro Platform to serve a vibrant and growing group of app founders and developers in the Stacks ecosystem. We’re publishing this post to get early community feedback. We want to hear from developers who’re building apps &amp; smart contracts for Bitcoin and help make their lives easier. Please share your comments on the <a href="https://forum.stacks.org/t/introducing-the-hiro-platform/11957">Forum</a>.</p>',

Meaning, you just design and platforms like Webflow write the code for you.</p><h3>Embedding stuff</h3><h4>Tweets</h4><div></div><h4>Code</h4><p>Code can be embedded the hacky way using a h6 tag:</p><h6>&lt;p&gt;hello&lt;/p&gt;</h6><p>But you can also embed gists:</p><div></div><h5>Blockquotes</h5><blockquote>Stripe, Apple Pay, Paypal, or Google Pay, while also extending your stores capabilities with various integrations.</blockquote><p>If you approach Webflow with the mindset of designing, based on the fundamentals code, you’ll be able to learn it quickly. And on top of that, you might end up learning how to code as well.<br></p>',

        "<h3>Inter-disciplinary problems</h3><p>Say you're working on a blockchain. Not only do you have to worry about traditional software engineering and distributed systems problems (like data structures, consensus, high-performance networking etc), but you might also need to think about game theory, monetary policy, incentive design, behavioral economics and so on.</p><p>Crypto is full of inter-disciplinary problems!</p><h3>✨Innovation</h3><p>For all the (often valid) criticisms of crypto – it's a \"wild wild west\"; it's full of scammy projects and shitcoins; there's only hype &amp; speculation and no projects creating meaningful value etc etc – I've found that in reality, there <em>is</em> a lot of innovation in crypto; there <em>is</em> an openness to experimentation and questioning of assumptions that's lacking in the Silicon Valley machine that's become optimized to identify and reward certain patterns.</p><p>At no other point in my career thus far have I truly felt like we were at a frontier, I feel surrounded by innovation – it's invigorating and exhilarating!</p><h3>🎯 Mission &amp; Impact</h3><p>Perhaps you are jaded by the problems inherent in building ad-supported businesses where individual privacy is often fundamentally at odds with the business or perhaps you feel too much power consolidating in the hands of a few is dangerous or perhaps you feel far too many people are ignored and under-served by our financial institutions.</p><blockquote>Or maybe you find it frustrating that in 2021 it still takes several days to transfer money between bank accounts (even your own!). Or perhaps you see that most of us are merely renting our online identity, our data and our digital assets and perhaps you feel there <em>should</em> exist a new internet (and apps) where you have true ownership over your identity, data and assets.</blockquote><p>Whatever your passion, chances are you'll find one or more crypto projects whose mission &amp; values resonate with you, and where you might have the potential to have a huge impact.</p><h3>🕑 It's early</h3><p>Despite the rallies, ATHs, the upcoming Coinbase IPO and many impressive milestones, as an industry, crypto is still in it's infancy. Consider:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/\">Global crypto market cap</a> crossed the 2 Trillion USD threshold recently; global market cap overall exceeds <a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/\">88 trillion USD</a>.</li><li>The most generous estimates of developers who've had <em>any</em> exposure to crypto is &lt; 10,000. Most projects, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have a tiny number of core contributors. Very few developers have written any smart-contracts. Contrast this with the &gt; 10 Million developers out there.</li><li>While some projects and some DeFi application have traction, reality again is that the vast majority of developers and end users simply don't care about crypto or blockchain. Anyone claiming the industry has figured out 1) clear value propositions for users &amp; developers alike (what does it let them do 10x better than the current alternatives?) and 2) how to effectively communicate these value propositions, is probably lying 😅</li></ul><p>Don't fall for the zero-sum narratives of Ethereum-killers and which blockchain will win. I'm much more interesting in growing the pie, and of course, ensuring that <a href=\"https://stacks.org/\">Stacks</a> has a meaningful share of this pie.</p><h3>🦄 Ownership &amp; Liquidity</h3><p><em>Caveat: I'm not a lawyer. This is not investment advice. Do your own research.</em></p><p>Despite the heady valuations and glamorous exits, the reality is that for the vast majority of startup employees, unless you happen to be very very lucky, a meaningful financial outcome is going to be rare. And even if you do get lucky, there are other hurdles and it's easy to make mistakes: tax treatment of stock options; early exercise and 83(b); inability to exercise options after an exit; tax treatment of RSUs; vesting schedules; lack of liquidity for vested options / RSUs; lack of transparency in secondary markets; lack of access to public markets etc etc.</p><p>If we agree that on the premise that \"<a href=\"https://nav.al/renting-time\">You won't get rich renting out your time</a>\", and that the path to wealth is through building equity and ownership, then I'd argue crypto offers some compelling alternatives to the traditional startup scenarios.</p><p>To be clear, holding and trading crypto tokens come with their own risks and complications. But the point is that they offer <em>different</em> options, with their own trade-offs. Do your due diligence!</p><h3>🌎 Community</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/memes-defi-cryptocurrency-yam\">Crypto memes</a>, \"<a href=\"https://chainlinkecosystem.com/ranks/\">Link Marines</a>\", \"<a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/xrp-sentiment-manipulated-by-thousands-of-bots-analyst-claims/\">XRP army</a>\" – communities have been an integral part of crypto from the start. Just like the best product or the best technical solution doesn't always win the market, claims of having the \"best blockchain\" don't make a crypto project successful: a thriving, healthy, welcoming, inclusive community is key.</p><p>If you like open-source, enjoy working in the open, if you believe in the ideas of decentralization, if you like engaging with a broader community, you may find a crypto community that resonates.</p><p>So there you have it, just some of the reasons why I think you should contemplate a career in crypto. Most of us working in tech have immense privilege (one that I'm acutely aware of and truly grateful for): our downside is very very limited – the worst case scenario in most startups is that you walk away with a cushy salary.</p><p>And so I encourage you think about the best-case scenario instead, not necessarily in terms of financial outcomes, but the vision / mission. Yes, there's risk, but for me, if I'm able to nudge the world ever so slightly in the direction of true ownership online, that would make it worthwhile.<br></p>",

        "When you're ready to start stacking, you'll need to decide whether to stack in a pool or by yourself, for how long, and how much. Stacking may seem daunting at first, but hopefully this post will shed some light on the factors that impact your rewards and help you choose a strategy that’s right for you.",

        '<p>There are two ways to stack: in a pool or by yourself. To stack by yourself you’ll need to meet the dynamic minimum of currently 100,000 STX. If you don’t meet the minimum, you can still stack by pooling with others. However, even if you do meet the minimum you might want to pool depending on your preferences.<br></p><h2>🌊 Pooling</h2><p>A pool will combine all participants’ STX, stack it on their behalf and then distribute the rewards. There are two types of pools: custodial pools such as exchanges and non-custodial pools that use the native stacking smart contract. Unlike custodial pools, non-custodial pools will never be able to access your STX, but you do still need to trust them with the payment of the rewards. The upside to pooling is that you’ll be able to stack even if you don’t meet the minimum and that a pool will generally stack more than an individual. This decreases the impact that the dynamic minimum has on participants’ rewards.<br></p><h5>Pooling is recommended if:</h5><ul><li>You own less STX than the minimum required for stacking by yourself. You can see the current minimimum on <a href="http://stacking.club">stacking.club</a>.</li><li>You own enough STX to meet the minimum, but an increase in the minimum would have a significant impact on your rewards (more on that in the <em>dynamic minimum</em> section)</li><li>You don’t mind trusting the pool with the payment of your rewards</li></ul><p>You can discover pools on <a href="https://www.stacks.co/stacking">stacks.co/stacking</a>. If you\'re going to pool, make sure you\'ve researched and trust the pool.<br></p><h2>🧍 Stacking by yourself</h2><p>When you stack by yourself you’ll interact with the protocol directly. The upside is that you won’t have to trust anybody with the payment of your rewards as you’ll receive them directly from miners. The downside is that an increase in the dynamic minimum can have a larger effect on your rewards than it would on a pool.</p><h5>Stacking by yourself is recommended if:</h5><ul><li>You don’t want to trust a pool with the payment of rewards</li><li>You own at least enough STX to meet the minimum, and ideally enough where an increase in the minimum has a minimal effect on your rewards (more on that below)</li></ul><p>When you stack by yourself, you’ll have to consider how likely it is the minimum will increase, how big an impact an increase would have on your rewards, and the impact of the cooldown cycle.<br></p><h3>📈 The dynamic minimum</h3><p>Every cycle 4,000 reward slots are available for stackers. The minimum required for one reward slots can change from cycle to cycle — if an additional 40 million STX starts stacking, the minimum will increase by 10,000 STX. As a result, you could end up with less reward slots if the minimum increases in the future. Imagine the current minimum is 80K and increases to 90K. Here\'s how it would impact your rewards:</p><ul><li>If you stacked 80K, you\'d lose 100% of your reward slots.</li><li>If you stacked 160K, you\'d lose 50% of your reward slots</li><li>If you stacked 400K, you\'d lose 20% of your reward slots</li><li>If you stacked 8M, you\'d lose 12% of your reward slots</li></ul><p>As you see, the impact of an increase in the minimum will have less effect the more you’re stacking. Pools are also impacted by the dynamic minimum, but they’ll often stack much more than an individual. That’s why it’s recommended to stack in a pool if your balance is on the lower end.</p><h2>📆 How long to stack</h2><p>Both when pooling and when stacking by yourself, you can decide to stack between 1 to 12 cycles. A cycle is always 2,100 Bitcoin blocks, but the Bitcoin block time varies — a cycle generally lasts around 15 days. To decide how many cycles you\'ll stack you\'ll need to keep in mind the cool down cycle, and in case you\'re stacking by yourself the dynamic minimum as well.</p><h3><strong>⌛</strong>The cool down cycle</h3><p>After your chosen duration, you’ll have to wait one cycle before you can stack from the same address again, regardless of whether you pooled or stacked by yourself. Your yearly returns (APY) will be higher if you stack for more cycles at a time. For example, If you stack for 3 cycles at a time twice, you’ll be earning rewards 6 out of 8 cycles, with two cool down cycles(•••-•••-). If you stacked for 6 cycles at a time, you would have earned rewards 6 out of 7 cycles (••••••-). Revisiting the cool down cycle is part of the considerations for the <a href="https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/discussions/16">Stacks 2.1 upgrade.</a> </p><h3>📈 The dynamic minimum (if you stack by yourself)</h3><p>In general, stacking for more cycles will decrease the impact of the cool down cycle and in turn increase your APY. However, if you’re stacking by yourself you’ll also have to consider the dynamic minimum. The minimum can change from cycle to cycle, and becomes harder to predict the more cycles you stack. If you’re stacking an amount where an increase of the minimum will have a significant impact, consider stacking for less cycles or adding a buffer. If you’re stacking so much that an increase of the minimum will have little impact, consider stacking for longer to maximize the cycles you’re earning rewards.<br></p><h3>Resources</h3><p><a href="http://hiro.so/wallet">Stacks Wallet</a> by Hiro enables you to pool and stack by yourself with Ledger support.</p><p><a href="https://stacking.club" target="_blank">https://stacking.club</a> will give you insight into stacking data, such as how much STX is stacking for next cycle and how the dynamic minimum has changed in the past.<br></p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23stacking">#stacking</a> channel on the <a target="_blank" href="http://stacks.chat">Stacks Discord</a> is where you can ask questions about stacking. Most pools are active on Discord as well and will gladly answer any question you might have.</p><p>Happy stacking!</p>',
